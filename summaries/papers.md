## Model of Agile Software Measurement: A Case Study

### Background
- Measurement for Agile Development are mostly quantifiable as in KPIs
	- Not taking culture, context and environment into account
- Teams (3) use Scrum methodology consist of of programmers, quality analysts and two scrum masters
- Defined measurement
	- Single unit of measurement
	- Focus in influential parameters
	- Take proxy variables into account, use them with transfer function
	- Dysfunction: Parameter value discrepancy - cause/effect
	- Resistance: Hawthorns, cheat in comparisons
- Distinguished measurements
	- Agile: Measure-up vs value-up (low measuring vs. outcome and value)
	- Performance: KPI (value drivers), TA (financial metric)
	- Traditional: conformance to plan
	- Production: Lean (lead time, queue, WIP), Cost, Business value, Quality (technical debt, defects)

### Method
- Case study performed at Bwin games
- Constructive research (model from research problem based on action research)
- Six defined phases from: define, measure to collection and analysis
- Using semi-structured interviews

### Results
- Insights on workflow
	- Lack of integration of agile on various levels (levels or organization)
	- Developer estimations were not always trusted
	- Architects distrust measurements fearing their work being unnoticed
	- Traditional metrics were not aligned with Agile metrics
	- Bonuses and beliefs undermine metrics (just by belief)   

### Limitations
- Bwin group just merged with other company, high degree of uncertainty
- Few participants in semi-structured interviews
- Framework dev influenced by mid management (should be independent)
