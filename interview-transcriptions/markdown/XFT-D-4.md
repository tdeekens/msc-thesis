### And how about your communication with your line management?
We have a new manager since a couple of weeks back. So... and it's kind of hard to answer cause that communication is rather new so I don't know if, I think he has claimed that he will be available. But I haven't, there hasn't been any reasons to check it if it's like that. So I can't really say... But as a manager he had said: "Just gimme a text or mail me if you have a question - if you need stuff.". So I guess it will be good but I haven't tried it out.
### And what were the reasons for changing it?
The old manager left.
### Ah, ok that part....
Yeah the old manager left by the end of January. And then we were, we didn't have a the nearest position of manager were started in the middle of March. So we had him for three weeks or so. 
### How did it affect the team, not having a manager? Or did it affect the team?
Yeah, I think it affected the team. We were, there were a lot where they could not put up the ad for the position cause somebody in India has not pushed a button. There were a new, new ways of doing all the ads and there were actually a lot of ads stuck because those who evaluate the ads were situated down in India. And well of cause, well they made a new system and they had a huge pile, a lot of things to do. And they weren't allowed to do it in the old way so everybody was kind of waiting for things to happen. And that of cause... We knew we needed a new manager but then it took four or five weeks and then it actually said "plop" and then our grandpa manager were able to have some interviews and it took a couple of weeks. But kind of, when you don't have a manager you, we didn't get, some of us were applying for vacation and we didn't get the vacation approved because we didn't have that manager. So there are stuff that the managers are doing that we were lacking. So we were, thought it was good when they found a manager for us.
### Did it in any way affect the work of the team, apart from the administrative aspects?
No, I would't say that because we are... the action work about features is run more through the OPO and ScM and in that loop about the TMs in the projects. So we are getting our work from that so in that case it weren't affecting us.
### To that extend are you involved in decisions around the backlog? Can you decide on what stories you are gonna do this sprint?
Yeah in some way actually. We have, in your three teams, we have divided the base load as we call it. We have to answer a mailbox, we have to do deliveries on our code and we also do regression tests on our code. So we divided that on the three teams, each of one took a task. And on top of that we also have, right now have the responsibility of the PDU of developing software for a new hardware that is called PDU-301 [???] and that is a rather long one. So we have written stories about that one, a lot of stories then. When we are doing our sprint planning, we can go in there and say "Now we want to start on story 5, 8, 9. They are the most important now.". And then we are actually going to our OPO and say "We are choosing these stories, are there something you want to add, do you know that we need to add into that sprint?". So lately we are having a great influence on, not that we could take a completely new feature so to say but we have a great influence on what we take. On what order what we take that feature, that is no one pointing to us. 
### And you're satisfied with this?
Yes I think it's rather good to give us some kind of, we know that we are developing this one and we know that it will take a couple of months and we are able to plan and do our work in the way that we think it's good. I wouldn't say it would be better... but the sprint planning it has improved a lot I think. When we at first started all the tasks were up on the table and one team said "Ah, we like to do that" and another would say "We like do to that" and then we put that up on the board and then we'd say "Now you have every much and we have very few and we can take some of you because..." so the sprint planning took the whole afternoon, now we are doing it for half an hour an hour and then we're checking it with our OPO for half an hour and everyone knows what to do. So I think it's much better about sprint planning today.
### If you would have to define characteristics for a good sprint, can your think of something like "if we always have this, the sprint is gonna be good" and on the other hand "if this happens the sprint is gonna be bad"?
Oh, that was a hard question. I think it depends on how our team is, we are one... I have my main competence in system, I have my main competence in verification and then we have three, four people... we are a rather small team right now: four people in that are designers. So we found out that if we have a sprint with not that much coding in then some of us think that we don't have that much fun work to do. And that tends to... then you get a more "ok, we need to do that so lets do it" kind of. So I would say it's a good sprint for us if we have coding but that's only depending on the people in our team so to say. It's not good if we only have administrative work in different kind of ways then people get annoyed I would say like we have a lot of documentation systematisation, a lot of mailing, a lot of trying to get an attribute in the MOM that could take ages. We work on preparing getting stuff into the MOM and we weren't getting that, so we... the preparation for getting it in took quite a while and thinking. And then we we got it denied so: "ok let's start again". And that was of course frustrating as we were trying to do stuff that didn't come through. And we are also frustrated as I described in the communication way. That we need to get information from GSM and WCDM and sometimes it's very very hard for us. So when there is some sprint that needs some confirmation then it's also starting to get angry and not angry but kind of annoyed. This is not working good kind of.
### And might there be any another external influences if you have the perfect setup already and then something comes up which kind of ruins everything? Is there such a thing which influences sprints externally or is it shielded?
No, it's not shielded: we could get other stuff in but that usually comes from the OPO then but then he comes a long and says we need to do that and usually that haven't been so much that we had to break the sprint but we could take it in and prioritise and perhaps not being ready with all the stuff that we thought we should have been ready with. So I don't know if there are, yeah we have a new organisation ongoing that is of course sprint breaking but I mean that is not common that usually happens once a year or twice a year. So that's not that much for your thesis about... sprint breaking stuff.
### And how much vision of the product is communicated to the team? How much far ahead do you know what you're going to do?
No that far that we want to know. We have been... before I would say one year ago that was communicated much much more and now it's no communication in that area. And we have said that we are lacking it... We think it's sad is not the right word but we are kind of a little bit frustrated cause we don't get that information and it's so much funnier if you get the information where the product is heading and what's affecting the product. But we are not discussing the product that much as we would like to do.
### Do you know why it is not communicated?
No... Perhaps there the person that is PO thinks is not important. The PO changed one year ago and perhaps... but we actually don't know. We have trying to say that it's good for the spirit around the product, it's good about knowledge, it's good about if you could get information. But we are very close to hardware and that would be good also that someone could tell us that new hardware is autumn. Because some of the hardware guys is floor down and if someone were to tell us then we, when you're meeting them at lunch then you could ask then "I heard about this one and we are going to work with that could we...". So knowledge about where the product is going is very good if you have because it is getting some kind of... I don't know the English word for that but you get kind of an overview of the surroundings and stuff. And then you know when stuff happens and can have a ear there or start talking on the coffee machine. So we, in our team we think that is very sad that that is not been that much. So we were actually talking in our retro that we were thinking about... we had something called APC techno before and that was a place where we brought up different knowledge, general knowledge so to say. So we thought we could drive that techno and start to invite people to tell us about those things. But that was only 2-3 weeks ago and we haven't started that yet but that was a thought. Since we are lacking that information we thought that we could somehow get it, try to get it ourselves and then communicate it to our other teams, APC teams. So that was just a thought about it.
### Is there any other kind of information that you are lacking, any communication channel that you are lacking as well as you wish?
I can't really come up with something right now. We have divided the product guardian area but I think that has worked rather well. No I can't, right now.
### How are you as an XFT are sharing information with other, with anyone?
Yeah, we were part of the team exhibition of Wednesday and we share knowledge at, we have a sprint review that we have together with the other teams and then we have a presentation on what we have done. About the feature and where we are going but a lot of stuff. And each team has that kind of presentation and that's a very good opportunity to know about the other teams and that's how we communicate our work also. Then before we also had that APC techno and if we had something on that sprint review that we thought need more discussion then we brought it up on the techno. So we think that it's, that techno has not been there for half a year or something so we are missing it.
### And how does the empowerment of XFTs and giving them many responsibilities affect you? Would you like to have less responsibilities in some way?
No, but I would like to know my responsibilities and since there are not a good process about product development you actually don't know your responsibilities. And they are kind of saying, they are talking about end-to-end, that you should have responsibility end-to-end but if you don't tell us where it starts and where it stops then and what is the supposed outcome of this...
### And if you take a look at the organisation as a whole, do you see any entities in the organisation that are maybe not compatible with agile way of working?
I couldn't tell, really I don't have that knowledge.
### I think I am through. Maybe you're concerned with something we didn't ask about?
No, you have to ask the question. I am only answering the question. I don't you're after.
### Have you ever been in contact with your APO?
Yes I have.
### Was it very not frequent, would you like to see more?
No, that's not frequent at all. Yeah I am actually hoping that the reorganisation of the areas where they are forming new requirement areas. They have put up new APOs on that one, I think one is aiming for, the thoughts about this new requirement areas are good because they are making one that is infrastructure and one is called configuration features - I don't remember that one but what they are trying to do is to actually put the main requirement, the MR for something that is coming up in the infrastructure and that MR will both include hardware and software. Because nowadays we have kind of a problem cause hardware is doing the hardware and putting it out on in the field. And we are doing software and I think we are running after cause I think we are going "oh, is that one on its way out to the field? In that case we have to do the software in order to support it.". And I think that software should be done before because if it is done a little bit before then you could actually verify both: software and hardware together before you are putting it out. And now its, of course it's verified but not to, so extended verification, cause you kind of getting it to late. You are running your tests of course on it, it's not that but it could be more extended if the software was ready a little bit earlier because in that case what hardware could do their verification with real software and that's much better. Now they are putting there tasks together in one MR to get the hardware and the software together for the same product and that is one good thing because it might be one area that we are communicating to little and it is with hardware: where are they heading, where are they going. The OPO is doing that but I think be should have better knowledge.
# Ok, thank you.
