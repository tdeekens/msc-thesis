# So lets start then. So what is your role within the organisation and with respect to your XFT?

Yes, I am a software developer now I am mainly doing software design work basically it's writing code.

# ...and have you been working here before the transition towards agile?

No. I started here, almost half year ago. So when after they have started the agile way of working.

# ...and your main tasks just include development and nothing else? Or do you do something other than development?

Do you consider fixing those TR?

# Yeah, sure.

I think I have to do that, yes. And something else: before I also engaged in answering APC mailbox. It's kinda of, lets say if there are other part of the team has any question to the APC, they would contact through the APC mailbox and then there should be someone to answer questions. So I was responsible for that for two sprints or something like that. Or during that time I also had to, lets say if there is and that is a trouble in our product I have to say "Yes this is and we will take care or it." or "No, this is not you should do like this this" or something like that.

# ...and why did it change again, why are you not responsible for it anymore? Cause you said it has just been two weeks.

Two sprints, not two weeks - so six weeks. At that time because I was kind of tired of just answering questions and don't touch the code at all. I mean it happens at the whole day so I spend my whole day just answering e-Mail. I was kind of tired of that even though I think it is a good way to understand how people think. Yes, and then I just told the ScM that I want to do something developing task. So that's why I switched. 

# In general in the organisation, is it clearly defined what are you responsibilities should include? 

Clear defined. According to me. I think... you mean the XFT or in the organisation?

# ...both.

I think it is not that clearly defined. So if I want I could take some systematisation work and doing some verification work to extend my capability. But sometimes I know that maybe this kind of user story is not made for me for now so I won't touch that kind of story. I don't know if I answered you correctly.

# ...and as a XFT as a whole, is it clear what the team is supposed to do?

...as a XFT. I think yes. Yes, we got the user story to develop and we also got the base load to work with. So I think it is kind of clear.

# ...and do you appreciate that you can basically decide what you want to do yourself a little bit. That you can pick tasks?

Yes, I think that is okay.

# How different are tasks from sprint to sprint? Are they from the same domain? 

Hm, that depends on the work package we are working but they are usually for half a year. Yeah for this half year we work for two packages and some maintenance work I think. So it is kind of different but it is still based on the WP. Like each time has a main big task to do or maybe several many big tasks to do and then this team will begin with this task and then do the other when this task is done.

# ...and as an XFT which are the roles you communicate with during a sprint?

Hm, as an XFT member or as a whole team?

# ...as the whole team.

As a whole team we communicate with the OPO, PG and some project manager I think and also we have to communicate with hardware cause our product is kind of tightly connected to hardware. So if we finish a feature but the hardware is not done so then, how should I say, this feature is not done. We are also taking care of their plan and we also we need to consider about the ANSCI teams like their planning to... Is that ANSCI team, maybe not ANSCI team like the WCT-Online ??? and LTE release plan and so we need to fit to their deadlines. 

# ...and what are the main topics you talk about with your OPOs and PGs? And project managers?

...which kind of topic? 

# What is it you talk about with the OPO and how is it different from the topics you communicate with the PG? Is it all the same kind of things or does it differ and what is it?

No, for OPO we mainly discuss about the tasks whether we have such a capability to do this task in this sprint or not and then what we want to do. Such things. And we also need to listen to what he says about release plan at different part of the organisation and try to match with them. For the PG we mainly discuss about how the product is like, if things should be done like that. Such kind of things. How to do the documentation and such things. 

# Do you have any opinion on how well it works to coordinate the different teams as you mentioned? The scheduling, different release plans? Is that fluent or are there problems with it?

Because I just started half year I am still kind of confused by those release plan but I just think "oh okay, just meet the deadline before it is release date". So I am kind of confused when it comes to these kind of things. 

# And about your communication with your OPOs, PGs and project managers: how do you receive information? Are you happy with the amount of information and how frequently it comes to you as a team? 

We got information from OPO each sprint review and also that is something I forgot to mention every week we have a line meeting. And during that meeting we also hear some kind of story about of that release date and those TR situation. For me I am kind of happy or satisfied for the current situation. It's with the other release plan, what is going on. Yeah, I think it is enough. Or?

# ...you have to say...

# ...and how about the other way around? You as a team, how do you communicate with those roles? What information do you share? Is it only during the meetings or do you contact them whenever you have a problem or something like that?

As one team member, as me?

# ...as a team - as a whole team.

As a team as a whole. I think we do not communicate with OPO that much. At least for me. I know that sometimes my OPO comes to my ScM as asks what is happening. How tests are going, kind of things. And for PG, we could go to him whenever we want cause it is just some technic issue. And for project manager. Yes, sometimes that is sometimes when they show up in team area at least it is for me. I just feel that something is happening. Maybe a TR comes, maybe something you need to fix. Those kind of things. Or they just want to know how that project or PTR is going. 

# How often does it happen?

Recently we did not have that many TRs so I did not see them coming often. But before when there is a sprint we have 4-5 TR and there is some important TR it is going "have you fixed this and progress."

# Do you feel that the project manager is part of the team or somehow rather distant? Is he further away and not very close?

Yes, at least for me because I did not try to communicate with him directly. So I know there is office and those managers are sitting there but he is kind of far away from my daily responsibility.

# And if you want to talk to the OPO: would you talk to him directly or would you go to the ScM?

It never happened really before. But if there is a situation I need to talk to OPO I would go to my ScM and go to the OPO together with my ScM.

# Do you think that is the responsibility of a ScM to communicate outside of the team - that he is a hub?

Yes and no. It, how should I say. I want him to come together with me cause I want just someone to stand next to me. I want him to support my argument. But I really trust my ScM I don't know if that is another reason. I don't know whether I answered your questions? 

# Yes, you did.

# ...and what about your communication with other teams, other XFTs? 

It mainly about the technic or it is a knowledge issue - some knowledge sharing things. Cause sometimes we got a TR but we do not really know the details and I would go to the other team. Who is responsible for that task or they know more about that 

# Is it always clear who you should contact?

I would say: yes. Because for my team, we always communicate with others free. I don't know if I am allowed to say: we are kind of close to MS-3 and we know what kind of feature they did and they are doing. So you can just go and talk.

# And what about your line management: what are the issues you contact them about and how does it work from them to your team?

I think they are just agile coaching or trying to remove the impediments from the scrum board. And they are responsible for the daily administrative work and also spread what is happening in the organisation. Yes, I think that is their main task. And if I have some issue I would talk to my LM it would be the impediment or if I have some administrative like I am going to have vacation, leave those kind of things.

# Do you think it is sufficient how he works, how he spreads information about what is happening in the organisation? 

Yes. I think it is quite good. 

# ...and when you contact them about the impediments: is it fast how they impediment is solved? 

I think for know, because we just newly got a manager and I think he is good because we once discussed about the impediment of the lab and he contact and after two or three days he just write back an e-Mail saying that you could subscribe to what is happening with the lab: we're using this page. Those kind of things. So I think it is good.

# ...and can you contrast it to when you did not have a manager? Did it differ?

Did it differ? I am trying to think is there any impediments when we don't have a manager. An impediment is we don't have a manager at that time I think. I think when we don't have a manager we because some impediment could not be solved by the manager. I think they are helpful when they are trying to remove the impediment so there should be different.

# ...and how often do you have impediments and what kind of impediments can you have during a sprint?

For example if the hardware is not behave as we thought that we think is kind of impediments. And to update the hardware we need to send it to Finland and wait for 10 extra days until we got a new hardware. And then that this hardware is not working again. I think for this kind of impediment I don't think the manager could help. Yeah and for the other impediments, for the administration issue that is something they could fix. What kind of other impediment. For example, there are some kind of good enough hardware in the lab. I think our manager, LN trying to talk with lab responsible people that I don't think that anything could be changed cause hardware requires budget. That is kind of impediments I could think right now. 

# Are there any ways when the sprint can be interrupted? When you for example have some dependencies or unplanned work that was not in the sprint from the beginning?

Yes. Yes and no because we don't have dependency on other team cause we work on different task and those task are not dependent on each other. But there are lot of unplanned work, like this sprint we did a lot of black work. 

# Black work?

Like these things that should be done but are not planned so it's not reflect on the user stories. For example the hardware issue in the beginning. We are thinking that there maybe is something wrong with the code and then it takes some times and oh we find it is the hardware issues and we do this kind of unplanned work and we need to communicate with the hardware people. So you need to update something. This is kind of unplanned work. And if a super hot TR, super emergency come then we need to put our user stories here and start working on the TR. Yes, that also happened before but that's also not quite often. Lets say not every sprint but 30% of time.

# Where do TRs come from or why do they occur? Are they caused by you - is it the team or other teams at times? 

Why TRs comes, that is complicated. For example the first week here there was some super hot TR from Canada then they told us that there are 500 radio base station they are recycling like they are restart and restart and restart. And then later we found out that they did something wrong with database and then we how do I say: it is not our responsibility and then we route to another team. At that time we came up some work around so that hot TR is not that hot cause we provide a work around but that problem is not fixed. But yes, that is not our team's responsibility but we're doing it anyways cause that problem is showing up. How should I say, we are here (layer) in our product and somewhere here have some problem but it shows up in ours... And sometimes it is other team's like on the last one or last three they developed something and maybe then there are some small issue to fix and we have to fix it. 

# Is it something you take into account during the spring planning, that something might come up?

That is not predicable, right? Because we don't know whether there is a problem show up in customer but sometimes we could know that cause the APC mailbox some people would ask us in APC mailbox whether this is a problem or not and then we analysing that this is a problem please write a TR to us. But sometimes I think people quit TR because they don't know what is the problem so they write a TR on Skype or somewhere else and there is somewhere responsibly office and maybe that is our fault and then they put the responsibility in our - how should I say - group.

# Can you redelegate a TR if you see it is not your responsibility? Can you bubble it up again, give it to somebody else? 

Yes, yes but you need to have a good argument. Yes it happens and when we find that this ok is not our problem we just reroute to other team. Or if it is a crash TR and we say: we could not reproduce a problem in our lab we just reject. So yes it happens but TR is really unplanned work in most weeks of?

# Do you know who decides who is responsible for a TR?

In my team or?

# Sounds like some part of management gets all the TRs and then looks at the software components and says ok this TR should go to that team this to that.

No, I don't know.

# You don't know ok.

# Can you think of a sprint that was really unproductive in contras to other sprints?

Yes, yes. I think for example like the first week I joined we got that recycling TR and I worked overtime with my mentor at that time. Then trying to fix that and did a lot of communication work to Canada and somewhere else to convince them this is your fault. Yes I think at that time our burn down chart is like this. It is...

# Yeah, it does not burn.

Yeah, does not burn any. That is kind of unpredictable because that is my first week here and then my mentor after fixing the problem tried to calm me down. Saying it is not always happen like that. Yes and it is not always happen like that but that week is really unpredictable

# ...and can you think of a sprint that is really good, very productive where you solved all the stories?

No TRs and then no impediments from hardware then it is kind of a good. 

# ...so that is how you would describe the perfect sprint? No TRs, no...

Yeah, how should I say. Actually it is, TR depends cause TR have a different severity levels. If it is a customer TR it is hot so we need to pick it immediately. But if it is some internal TR and the level is kind of low then we could just put it there and when we have time fix it. So a perfect sprint, according is not not TR but that TR is not that emergent so how should I say, you don't have to pick it at once. It's like you could schedule what you want to do and you don't need to do the task switch. 

# How do you normally plan the sprint. Where do the stories come from do you discuss them with someone except from your team?

Except from my team? 

# Yeah.

We mainly discuss the story. How should I say that. Take my current WP as an example. We always do a sprint grooming or pre planning within the team and like what should be done and what is user story. Maybe I should go a little bit further. Ok, it's like when we have WP then that WP says that in your product you should do this, do this, do this. And then from that document we have those user stories in the handsoft ? of in the agile tool. Then when we are doing that story we have a pre plan meeting and we thinking what should be do with that story what is the DoD and then it ends up in the scrum board. Sorry, can you repeat your question?

# ...so you just get the stories for your sprint and then you just decide upon implementation but not about the stories? You don't communicate back to the OPO and discuss...

I think we pick the story cause the stories are dependent on each other but our OPO does not know that but sometimes our OPO would give us extra stories of what he heard of what should be done this sprint. So it's after the pre planning we have the planning and then we will tell OPO we will do this, this this and then OPO says ok and I also want you to do this this this. And then we put the story together and those points whether we could finish and prioritise the story. In most cases we decide what we want to do the story but the OPO would also give us task. 

# So would you say you have a vision for the part of software you are responsible for? 

Like I know what I want to do? 

# No, about the product you work with, do you know what is its main goal? What's the vision for three months from know? 

Yes, I think we have some kind of short term vision like this would be happen this year but I think this question, how should I say, this question also showed up in our sprint retrospective and my team members in general don't have an idea how the long term vision should be. What would happen within two years. 

# And do you feel the need to know this? Would it change something if you knew?

Actually. I think it will be good if I know but I don't feel it is needed at least for me. For me I feel happy as long as I find ok after a year I still have something to do in this team. 

# Do you know who is the one with the vision for the product?

Yes I think it is the OPO and the LM and the PO she is kind of the product owner so she should have the vision how this product should go after one or two years.

# And what the the responsibility of the program manager?

You mean the PO?

# No the program manager. What is his name: Johan. 

Johan, actually I don't know what is his responsibility but he just always show up in the sprint review and gives some stand up meeting in that coffee room and talking about the release date what is going on. That is what I know about him. But I don't know what else he is doing. And he is not the product owner, he is the project manager. 

# So he is the one you were worried about when he comes in...

No, no. That one I am worried about is Anna. Anna, she is wearing the hoodie and short hair.

# Ok, we'll look for that.

# How do you communicate your work to other teams? Like once you are done with a sprint, do you spread information around? What you achieved...

Yes in the sprint review we have to state what we have done this sprint and sometimes they would ask some question. Like how have you done this and such kinds of things and also we communicate during lunch and fika but that depends.  

# Do you feel the need to know what is going on in the organisation in general?

As an organisation or what is other APC teams doing?

# Probably only what other APC teams are doing cause this is the only part you work with, right? 

Yes, I think I know what they are doing but not into detail but in general they are doing this task and this. 

# And lets talk a bit about the organisation as a whole: do you think there are some parts within the organisation that are not very agile in the way they work? 

Parts which are not agile. As a whole organisation?

# Yes, so say they are very static it takes a long time for them to give feedback, it takes a long time for them to change something when you have something you would like to know...

For example the hardware part but I don't know whether they could work in an agile way. Yes, they could in an agile way. They could work in Kanban. For example if we want to update the hardware of what we are doing of what we are currently developing we have to send it to Finland, we couldn't get the, how should I say report it and do it in the current hardware. Because it is Ericsson and it is a supplier and we are not allowed to do that because of some process and... It that?

# And maybe something else just to give straight examples would be when somebody won't act because he is on a different long term schedule. So somebody is working on really long term iterations and you are doing short term ones and you want to know something and he says it's not part of my current WP - not WP but...

Hm, how should I say that. For example something happened last sprint. We, there was one team member found out that there is something lacking in another project but we needed those kind of code to fix our problem and then we informed that team and that team was ok we fix that. But that team at that time was working with an hot TR and then what our team member did was that he went to their team's repository and fixed their code and made a delivery on their repository. I don't know if that is agile cause to me it's agile cause we could have fixed the other team's code but that team also did not respond to us actually so I don't know how we should define these things. Otherwise I don't know cause I've only worked in APC and I don' communicated that much outside my role so I don't think that many case that is not agile. 

# And do you think there are some parts that are not supportive towards agile transformation and would like to work as they worked before? 

I don't know how they worked as before actually.

# And what about the DM and SM do you ever communicate with them? 

Like the manager of my LM?

# Yes.

Yes, we have an all employee meeting and that meeting is every month or once two month, I don't remember. And he would introduce what is happening in the organisation but I only newly joined them I am still not familiar with the organisation and sometimes he is talking about the organisation. I am confused and I am trying to find where am I but usually I couldn't.

# Do they ever delegate work to you?

No.

# Do you have any idea what they are responsible for?

Hm, not really. Responsible for our SM? I don't know whether it is the LM idea or it is the one above because sometimes we have kind of a forum. We have a software development forum, system forum and some LM are also kind of responsible for those kinds of forums. So I don't know if the idea is from the LM himself or if it is from the manager above.

# And is it something you would expect from this? Or would you like to know if it is from him or his manager? Do you really care?

No.

# And have you ever been in contact with other product owners? Further than the OPO like APO, TPO?

No, I think maybe we have I have, how should I say, the possibility to not directly contact but some kind of stand up meeting or some kind of meeting they would show up in the tv screen in the coffee room but I saw them they go to there.

# And the teams between themselves they communicate, spread information between them by meetings or CoPs. Do you ever attend them? Does someone from your team attend them?

Yes, like from the forum. Yes, sometimes I attend and it's interesting to know how other teams do their job and if there is any valuable thing to share. I attended but I never attended the verification forum but some system forum and design forum. 	

# And if you are the only one who attends this meeting how do you spread the knowledge within your team? 

Actually, if I am the only one. I think I never tried to spread what I got from it because I don't know whether I should make an argument for myself because I thought the invitation is send to all so if you are interested to get this knowledge you should just go there. And if, I don't know if it's spread knowledge but sometimes I said I went to this one and the topic is like this and that's all.

# You have anything to complain about the communication with different roles? Maybe something is not enough, maybe something is too much? 

I...something to complain I just think when they're trying to spread the knowledge it is also good to say what is the abbreviation. Yes, because I am confused when they talk about abbreviation I don't know if that organisation is kind of gate or a process or is that a product those kind of things. So I think they should make some abbreviation chart or something like that.

# Yeah, we could have used something like that when we started. And do you feel your team is comfortable with the amount of responsibilities you have? 

I know my team is in a situation where we are lacking of people so I think we're in a position where we have enough responsibility for now. But if we have more people and we have more time, maybe we could get more. 

# So it's not a problem of too much responsibility?

No, no it you mean to less responsibility or to much responsibility?

# Is it too little now? Would you like to have more?

Actually for know as we are lacking people some of the tasks we could not do as well as we wanted to. So it is kind of a problem of too much responsibility. But if we get more people we would like to have more responsibility. 

# That it. If you want to mention anything else?

No.
