# How do you get information normally? From different roles as well.
Mostly by email, except for the OPO, he always walks over and have a quick chat.

# When you have work for your sprint, do you discuss it with your OPO or do you just get a list of stories that you have to do and that's it?
Oh you mean before the sprint? More or less we decide what we should do. Of course the OPO has some issues, some stories sometimes we have the possibility to choose from. Of course we can by ourselves decide which kind of stories, if we are working with a feature then we can decide what we should do within that feature, that we decide ourselves. But on the overall scope, the OPO more or less says what we should do. Right now we are working on a feature that we have been working for at least 3 months and we know more or less what we are going to do when the feature is finished as well. But I would say that we have quite good possibilities to have impact on what we should do in every sprint.

# How about the vision for the whole wproduct you are working with, is it sufficient? Like you know what you are going to do, for example, in the next 3 months...
Yeah, in the next 3 months we know what we are going to do, but in the long term we right now have quite a bad situation I think because we don't have that picture. We have actually been asking for that, but we haven't got any feedback yet. Of course we have the backlog with features that they want us to develop for the next upcoming release, that release will be just before Christmas this year, but after that we would like to see also something with some more... "We would like the APC to be in every car" or whatever, I mean more of a huge picture, that we are lacking right now actually.

# How would it change the way you work if you had this vision?
I think it would be more fun, because then we could actually have more input on the product, beacuse then we would have some general vision on what we are about to develop in the future, so then I think it could be...It's hard to say we would do better work but in some sense a better work, because I know that we should develop A in the future and beacuse of that I actually put effort into creating this AB thing also. Like that.

# Do you know who has this vision?
Yes, I know, it's the PO. Not the OPO, the PO.

# Why doesn't he communicate the vision? If he has it, it seems fairly easy for him to just tell you.
Actually I think -- it's a she actually -- I don't think she has any. I think the problem is that she is not...If I should speak for myself, I don't think she is that interested in the APC, to have that vision for APC. That's the main problem. So she is some kind of working on daily basis what we should do and relying on other, putting workload on APC.

# Just for us know, what's her name?
It's Eva Cullman, she is sitting next to our OPO Jonas. On the same spot as my spot but on the other side of the room.

# Have you ever been in contact with an APO and further up in the PO chain?
Yes, a couple of times, yes. We have tried to get it down [???] and speak about their vision about things and features especially. And also the last feature that we have created was typically...There were some areas that were quite...It wasn't really decided how the customer wanted it to have and then we had quite a huge conversation to get their input since you can't read everything from the document. In that sense we had communication, yes.

# Do you think it is sufficient or would you like to have more of this communication in your normal work.
Yes, I think it is very good. We try to do the best, all of us. Of course if we can do better work by getting better infromation and on the other hand as well, they can see that we are actually developing what they want. I think it's very good.

# When you have tasks in your new stories and you need some more input on it's implementaion, do you always know who to contact?
Yes, from the story point of view, yes. Then there could be stories when we don't really know how to solve and then the first part of the story is to actually find out who to speak with. In most of the cases we know how to handle it.

# What can cause the impediments during your sprints?
TRs, extra work, and unexpexted stories, that didn't work out that well as you expected. It oculd be some delivery that is delayed or something like that. That was I guess the most... And also we have quite a lot, especially at Ericsson, we have lots of other meetings that show up suddenly, some pre-study that starts and we really need to attend that one beacuse we going to work with that in 2 months or something like that. That could definetely be someting that stops us.

# Do you feel like these meetings you have to attend is something unnatural in agile context?
Probably could be better to say no, but sometimes if we don't attend these meetings then we have more work in the furute just beacuse we didn't give the input from the beginning. So it's hard to say. Perpahs I would say that 50% we could say "no" to and it wouldn't be noticed at all. But in some cases yes, it is definitely important that we answer a mail or attend the meeting, whatever it would be.

# Do you think there are parts in the organization that are not compatipble with agile?
Yes, theere definetely it.

# Which are these?
Or you mean that they can't be transferred to agile? No-no, I think the most of the work caould be done in agile way. More or less you could use the same kind of work for all different, even if you work with hardware or software or whatever, then I actually think you could use the agile way of working, that you have to be more open-minded in a sense of how long is the sprint and so on. But if you just look at the Scrum for itself then I definitely think it is applicable for all areas, definitely all areas I ahve been involved with.

# And if not areas are at the same kind of stage in agile, which are kind of behind a little bit?
Hardware I know, they have been behind just because they have those long, they need to order hardware themselves for such a long time before they can really see the hardware and so on. Actually, right now I don't know how long they have come, because they are going to be agile as well in the future, I just know we have had some issues that they have been doing the process with the old waterfall and we have been agile, that way we have had some clashes.

# So when I asked and you said "no" you were thinking about this or?
Yes, I was thinking about that, but I definetely think they can be agile as well. Motsly it's the mindset I think.

# Do you think there is lack of support towards the transformation somewhere?
Not that I've heard of. Especially our new manager talked about this -- he didn't talk about that especially -- but I was a bit surprised that they have been working quite a lot with this that I wasn't aware of, so the transfomration is acually ongoing more than I am aware of.

# Why do you think the hardware sector, for example, is stuck in a bit of waterfallish process?
I think it has to do with historical reasons definitely... I've been working with the hardware as well some years ago and it actually is a problem that you don't have this short loops all the time, sometimes you need to order something and it could take 3 months before you have the feedback on what you actually have done during that time so. So it's different kind of challenges than you have in software developing, beacuse in software in general you can just write the lines, extra source code lines, and then it's finished for that day, you can see the effect more or less immideately.

# Lets go back to your sprint work. When you have these TRs coming, who puts them in your sprint, where are they coming from in the organisation?
They come from the TR1 or TR2[???], it's actually our support organisation, and it could also be that they come from one of our sister prodcuts within Ericsson. Sometimes TR show up at another place and then we realise it's actually APC's fault. We have a common, all TRs that come to the APC come to the same place and then from that place we divide it between teams. So if we are lucky then we will have no TRs, we divide it by mod 3 so if we are lucky then we have no TRs at all.

# Can you think of a sprint that was really unproductive and what were the causes of this unproductivity?
We had once sprint, it was in some way unpredicted, because there is general sports vacation we have in Sweden in February when everyone is free for one week, that was predicted. A tthe same time we also had temporal parental leave, Magnus got sick with his children, I was sick with my children and so on. I think we counted that we were only 3 team members for the whole sprint in total. That was the reason, there wasn't much to say, we didn't have the resources that we needed to fulfill what we were expected.

# And if you have the resources, what could ohterwise impact the sprint to be unproductive?
Then it could be TR work for example. Most of our TRs that sow up are not that important, those could be taken next sprint or we can plan for them later. Sometimes we have those with a red alert sprints and we had one, I don't remember, 1 year ago, something like tha, that started up as a small TR that someone started to wrok o nand the suddenly it got really, red alert on it, so everything within Ericsson was almost stopped beacuse this TR must be solevd. And then of course, at least 2 of the teams were involved at the samt time and it took 1 week to solve it. So that could of course happen.

# On the contrast, can you think of a sprint that was really good and you burned all the stories? What were teh characteristics of the sprint?
We didn't manage to solve all the stories but we had really good progress -- I think it was 1 or 2 sprints ago -- we did very much work. And the reason, I think, we had several small stories so we could work in parallel with several small stories. Many of our stories are actually that we should book a meeting, we should have that meeting in the week or something like that and we need to do some preparation sometimes, but if you have several of those then you can actaully more or less work with them in parallel and sometimes even compare them when it's necessary. For example, have 2 issues at the same meeting or something like that. 

# So if you were to describe the perfect setup for the sprint, what would it be?
Of course the small stories, but also stories that are suitalbe for all team memers. Since we have one that is good at testing and one that is good in designing and one that is good in documenting and so on, then if course it would be good to have...6 team members, it would be good to have 6 different areas and 2-5 point sotries within those areas, then it could be really good.

# Do you think that's possible to achive that for every sprint, smaller stories that suit team members better?
In some way yes, but then of course we have...For example, we don't always have test work to do, we don't always have documentation work to do, but we actually try to take stories or decide about, when we have our sprint planning we definitely think about this, even if in Scrum you shouldn't say that this story should be handled by that person and so on, but we have that in our head any way so if we see... If we have some possibilty to choose about stories to add to the sprint then if we have no testing stories and there is one testing story left, then perhaps we take that in just because then we up, we have something for you [????] as well, beacuse of course it's good that all the team members try to learn all areas, but I also think it is important that you have your comfort zone in some way. Personally I think it's really good for me anyway, if I wouldn't... For me it's good to have a small design story and then some documantaion stories at the same time, beacuse I really would like to do some programming but at the same time I am very fond of learning other stuff as well and that is good. It's the same if you are a tester I think, if you have a testing story, then you know "This I can do fast" and then you also have the time to dig into new areas.

# The WPs you get, do they differ significatnly in domain and the area of work?
Not that much, but some stories are connected to hardware, directly to hardware, and some stories are just software related. In that sense it differs a bit, but since our source code is not that huge so more or less, I think, most of the stories affect all the parts...even if you are not developing the hardware, but at least almost from the hardware to the top interface the customer sees.

# Do you think it helps if you have this narrow scope of work? Not the narrow, but there are borders and you know where your responsibility ends?
I think that's more up to each and every person. Personnaly, I really prefer to have a broad vision on what I'm doing and then I know some people are actually fond of working on the algorithm quite long and just want to have that the WP will only be an algorith or something.

# We showed you the network we drew from the survet week and we saw lots of external structuures you sommunicate with as a tema, does it somehow affect your work, that you have to talk to so many different roles?
Yes of course it does. Beacuse I donät have that much time to spend on the stories actually. Yes, definetely does.

# Would you like it to be different in any way?
No think it's fun actually. Sometimes it's a bit too much, but I also think that myself sometimes to say "no" also. I have a tendency to think it's sometimes I think it's so fun to speak to new persons that I immideately answer that mail and so on instead of actually continue working on what I actually should do. I try to focus sometimes, but.

# As far as we know, for you as a Scrum Master it is your responsibility to take out the impediments for the team out. Do you know where your responsibility ends and when you have to delegate it to the LM?
I would say yes. If I'm not sure then I ask my SM and we come up with a proper solution.

# We know that you didn't have one recently, did it change anything?
Yes, we have solved all our problems actually. Ok, we still have some impediments that are not solved but so far we have seen progress on them.

# Your SM's manager, department manager, at that level, do you know hat is their responsibility and how it differs between your SM and his manager?
In some way yes, bu tI don't really have a full picture of what my manager's manager is acually doing during the day.

# So you would say that you don't have any communication with them?
I have communication with him as well, but not that much. Most of the times I take it with my SM and then he forwards it. Actually, just in the beginning of this week, I had a conversation about a TR that was really important and then I was ahving that discussion with Anders (that is the manager's manager), so he was involved in this, so this was on the higher level, it was actually quite high up above that they wanted us to solve it. So then I was responding to this mail and had a conversation with him as well [???].

# Do you think it slows the pricess, if you have to talk to your SM first and then he has to take it further and then that gut has to take it even further, and then it has to go back?
Yes, it some sense it could do it. But I also think it's good taht you have this kind of...so you don't bother everyone about every small issue. If I talk for myself, I don't have any problem if I'm feeling that something is very urgent and I already know that my SM will not handle this then I have no problem calling the next manager in the line and so on.

# How about your program manager, do you communicate with him and what about?
I don't know who is the program manager...

# Johan, he sits over there.
Yes, I don't have that much to him. He is doing some presentations about upcoming dates and so on, but I don't regualrly have that much to do with him. [??????34:58] but mostly that work.

# Team as a whple, do you think you have too many responsibilities or too little?
I think we have too much actually.

# In waht regard?
For example, testing. We are supposed to do too much tesing that we don't have any knowledge about actually. Of course it's no problem, we have learned it during when we needed but it also takes time form other stuff instead. So yes. I really think it's good, this XFT way of working, I think we should have this way of working, but anyway, we should have a border somewhere, this is acutally something we need help with when we step out of, for example, testing. Definitely we should handle feature testing so to say, but when this feature is entered into the complete system and so on, the I'm more questioning if we should have that responsibility, beacuse is takes so much time just to get to know the systems, how they are testing and so on. The same goes for designing as well, beacuse we know our code base, but sometimes we need to have code in another area, for example, WVCMA [???], something like that, and then we spend days just on getting to know their code and so on, beacuse it's sadi that we should do all development, but... Yes, we could do it, but it takes several days more than if we just ask someone who knows this from te beginning.

# Do you have any idea on how you can improve on that?
