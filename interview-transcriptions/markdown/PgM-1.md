### What is your role in the organization and what is your relation to the XFT Picnic?
I’m a Project Manager number 2, the main Project Manager is in Kista, I am also the Technical Coordinator for the project, CAT project.
### And what are your key tasks and responsibilities?
I would say technical coordination.
### What is embodied by technical coordination, what does it contain?
It contains definition of WPs, it contains information spreading about what other teams are doing. Technical coordination, it could be anything.
### Have you been working here before the transition towards agile?
Yeah, I have been working here before the agile transformation.
### What have you been doing then? Was it different from what you are doing now?
Basically not, I would say. I’ve been both a Project Manager, System person or some kind of technical coordinator.
### Would you say that now, in the agile context, responsibilities for your role are clearly defined?
No. In the agile context I wouldn’t say it is clearly defined. I don’t think you define a Technical Coordinator. You don’t define a Project Manager role either, actually. So, no, it’s not defined.
### It’s not defined and it’s good that it is not defined, is that what you are saying?
No, a lot of concerns, many people are worried about the roles in the agile transformation. I’m not.
### Why not?
I don’t know. I actually don’t know. You could also look at… Some people say that I am more like a PO for the POs in some kind of hierarchy, so in that sense I fit in the agile way, even though you don’t maybe define the hierarchies in the, at least not in the Scrum methods. But there is a need of some kind of hierarchy because we are so many teams. But in that sense the agility hasn’t solved that problem, working a lot of teams coordinated. That’s up to yourself or up to the organization.
### And what are the roles you normally communicate with during your work?
Everyone. I really mean everyone.
### Are there any that are more frequent than the other ones?
No, I mean the most… I am mainly concerned in those teams that have a lot of logistics with others and helping them. Logistics with other organization, I would say, like verification site or CI, I would say, and System site.
### How well do you think the information is circling between your communication environment? Do you lack some kind of information or maybe there is too much unneeded information?
I don’t like information, I fetch information myself, but I think I have problems spreading enough information.
### In what way?
I think the team needs to know a little bit more about their environment. If it’s a clear task just involving one team and they have a few interfaces, then they can handle it by themselves. But when it gets complex they need a little bit too much of information and more than they can handle, so to say. And all this is about giving the overall picture to the team, so they can handle task by themselves, that’s really the whole idea we are doing this, they should understand the total task. I think I lack that a little bit, to I think I fail to spread that information.
### Is it only your responsibility to do so?
No, it’s not only my responsibility. But it’s quite heavy on me since I am both a Project Manager and a Technical Coordinator.
### Bit is it a general problem then that information doesn’t reach the teams as it should at times?
Yeah, I would say it is.
### Any ideas on how it should be handled, should it be just informal and be communicated to them normally to should it be…
No, I think it depends on which team we are talking about. People are used to a working method since before and it’s both ways, I would say, some teams haven’t learned their responsibility for the total picture, and still would like to have the information put down to them. And I put some heavy work for the OPO or for others around them.
### How well do you think information is circling between the teams?
It depends, I would say. It depends on a team, which teams are collaborating. Because I have some examples where it is really good and some examples where it’s not.
### Do you see any common patterns, why is it good with some teams and not with the others?
No, I can’t say there is any pattern. I would say it can depend on how [?????] team is and how they are different personality, how they are within the team.
### Can they somehow be taught to be more mature?
Yeah yeah, of course they can.
### Are they taught?
I’m trying. I try. It’s not only my responsibility, it’s the Team Coach’s as well. The collaboration, the information spreading has always been…I mean, that’s a huge problem to solve in the organization like this. You can always answer these questions, «ok, no, this is not good enough». And I also try to spread the right information. This is a key question, but there is no clear answer either.
### How tight is your collaboration with the line management?
Not that tight, I would say. We are trying to improve there as well. Since I do prioritizing the teams and the line is coming in second hand.
### So it’s a trade-off between the two…
Yeah, I would say. A trade-off between my time.
### So the more you move towards the line, the less attention teams would get?
Yeah, the line should probably not move towards me, but more towards the teams. That’s my solution to it.
### What about OPOs?
That’s my closest cooperators so to say.
### How are you different with you communication with XFTs, you and OPOs?
That’s a good question. It’s a little bit more planning with OPOs, together with them divide the task in the proper way so that we can spread a huge task to several teams. That’s me towards the OPO role I would say. And towards the teams, it might more or less be like me I have quite a good picture of the total system, to give the explanation of how it works from a top level, to get a total grip.
### How well do you think you communicate the total vision to the teams?
I think I am doing it quite well, actually.
### In what way do you communicate it?
Talk. It’s very difficult to get feedback if you have people understood. Cause it’s all about understanding. Of course I send mails as well, but that would more or less be clean information, figures.
### About the empowerment of teams. You said that some teams are not ready to take a lot of responsibilities and are not kind of in the same pace with developing. Do you think some teams might also be overwhelmed with the amount of responsibility they are getting? Or should it be possibly for any team to just work in the same way?
I think we need to adapt, to understand that teams are composed by different people, different personalities, and do work a little bit different, and try to adjust to that. You can’t push everyone into exactly the same pattern. That’s the learning the organization needs to do. I don’t think we have come that far yet, I think we are pushing the same methods to everyone. But we are on different levels and I wouldn’t say, some people or some teams are quite narrow but more specialistic on an area, and some are more broad. Maybe it should stay like that.
### So it shouldn’t be more homogeneous between everybody being super broad and all the XFTs just…
No, of course it is good if everyone is broad and everyone knows everything in detail as well. But before we had different persons as well, some people are broad and some people were really into the deep shit. And now it’s the same with the teams. Of course it’s good with some kind of internal development, but we need to learn to accept the differences. We need to learn to accept the differences between people. That’s my opinion.
### If you look at the organization as a whole, where  do you think information is circling the best? Between which entities?
Which entities do I have here?
### The teams, OPOs, Program Managers, Section Managers, Department Managers…
I think the line is somewhat outside the loop in general.
### Why?
I don’t know.
### In what what does that affect the teams?
It affects them in a way that they get some quite a few small extra tasks to help the line to get into the…inside the organization. I think it takes some time from the team time.
### Does the line serve a clear purpose?
No. They should.
### But there is kind of room for the line to exist, that’s what I.
Yeah, yeah, it should be from the Team Coach perspective in this. But I think we have failed a little bit so far in that setup.
### Do you feel the countermeasures taken lately are appropriate?
We are improving, but we are not there yet, not at all, I would say. You have to ask the line about that as well, but I don’t think so, they are not really deep into the organization.
### Do you think there are some parts that are not compatible at all with the way of working you are now implementing?
Yeah, having a line developing methods and tools for different things tend without the agile help to be in a way it is used to be. We are just translating words to the new agile world. The old roles are kept if the line decides. Also mater of having the same, I would say, still have some profile, the leading positions in the organization which need to have something to do.
### Is it lack of willingness or support?
It is lack of knowledge. I think we would need help from outside with the agile transformation. But we decided to drive it form the Line Management perspective.
### And if you take a look at the whole building, like Ericsson Lindholmen, how well do you think the information is circulating between different organizations?
I couldn’t answer that. To me, I know quite well what they are doing, that’s a little bit of my role as well. I think the information is circling within Lindholmen, but not to other sites. We don’t get the influences from places on other sites that do belong to our own organization.
### Do you think the teams are in a way affected by this lack of knowledge of what is going on in the organization as a whole?
Yeah.
### In what way?
They get impediments that are… the voice from this organization is not heard well enough in the changes we need to do in other places. Like those changes we would like to have form system sites or from CI organization, it is not implemented there. So because we donut understand that organization well enough.
### And if you take a look a your communication, where do you think the problem is? What would be your first priority?
I think, still my first priority would be the OPOs and the teams in all aspects all the time. That’s my role. And I will always prioritize this. But that might the wrong. That’s how I’m thinking, they are going to do the work and they need information, so they will always be prioritized. With that I will always have the biggest problem.
### Does any communication within that priority affect you negatively? Or anything that comes up and kind of bother you at times?
No, I wouldn’t say so. No. From time to time, I haven’t heard that for a long time, it’s a problem if I steer the teams without having the OPO along the road because it’s not my role to really steer them or provide them with the correct information. I do the planning through the OPOs. And sometime by just talking to them I might just change that priority. That could be some mismatch, the negative feedback I have received.

### [……..]
I think it became a little bit of a separation between the line and the rest of the organization.
### Becomes noticeable from the OPO level, the teams say it’s cool, they don’t communicate with the line that much.
No they should, because they have a specific team coach form the line for each team, so it really should be a really close connection, but it isn’t.
…
I don’t think anyone has the same role as I do in the organization. So it might be a little bit own-defined so to say. Good and bad. I see myself as being quite agile thinking all along the road. That’s what everyone thinks.
