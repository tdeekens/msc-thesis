### What is your role in the organisation and what are your key responsibilities?

I am department manager so I am responsible for DF department here in our organisation.

### And what are the main tasks you do?

The main tasks that my organisation is responsible is provide teams, working in generation 2 (G2) program. So our line responsibility is to provide with competent team that can work efficiently with the task and manage the tasks that we had in the program.

### And have you worked here before the transition towards agile?

Before worked with...

### the transition towards agile.

Yes I have been involved in that. 

### And have you been doing something different before then?

Before the transition? My new role, or my role as it is today... I had the same role before the transition so started just after some new organisation so I get the position I have today before we started the agile transition. So it was just before so... I've had that role during the role transition. If that was the answer to your question.

### Yes more of less.

### And now do you see any obstacles on the way towards transitioning to agile, organisational structure wise?

I don't know if we should call transition to agile. I think we have started to change our way we work with another type of... so I am we will always be transforming ourselves with another way of work - continuously improving ourselves. So I don't know if we should call it transition cause I think we have ended that so now we are continuously improving things that are not so good and we will always do that. So I don't know if we are up in any transition. I don't see if we are up in the middle of any transition, right now.

### But different parts of the organisation transform in different speeds, right?

Yes.

### So are there some which are kind of left behind or are not transforming as easily, well as others?

I mean in our organisation, I think we are quite in the same spot. So we have not people or teams that are lacking... we are quite on the same level, I think in this agile way of working. And we work and the teams are quite similar of course it differs between teams but I think we are quite on the same level in the agile transformation - if you call that.

### And what are the roles your communication daily mostly consists of? What are the roles you communicate with most of the time? Say 3-5.

Mostly my managers those I have direct contact with many times per day. And they have a lot of connection with the teams but I also now have communicate with directly to the teams also since we have introduced one pilot things we call RUNDUN [???] where you walk with the whole leading team, walking around to some teams right now as we have it as a pilot right now. So we walked 3 o'clock every day to any team to see if they have anything we can help them with. So right now I also communicate a lot and have a lot of communication directly with the teams - some of the teams.

### And why did you start this pilot? 

We started it cause we wanted to increase the communication between the teams and the managers and I mean most of the managers are team coaches for the teams but the other managers don't have that information for other teams. They only have information regarding their own teams. Also I have not time to walk around for every team and be a part of their daily Scrum. So it's good for me also have a very short slot of every team every day so I can easily pick up if there is any problem with the teams. So now I have for 50 minutes I have collected three teams but I think we shall expand it so I can have 6 teams of 7 teams on very short time of period, of the day.

### And information you gather there, you will share with somebody else again? So it kind of moves up?

Yeah, if there is any impediments and there is any problem that needs to be taken care of but also it's good to know and also it's good for the teams so they now that there is an interest and an awareness of their work and their problem if they have any problem. So I think it is quite good. 

### Was that something the teams mentioned before that they kind of...

No it was actually Mats you have heard of it in other organisation. So we: "Ok, lets try it" so we have started a pilot of it and now we will have a retrospective of the first pilot and we hopefully increase it on more teams.

### And if we take the Picic and their OPO: How do you communicate?

With Monica. We have some meetings where we meet, we have stakeholder meetings and... we have... It's mostly stakeholder meetings I think. Otherwise we meet in the corridor and things like that.

### And the program manager?

I mean, those questions you have been asking is from a team coach perspective mostly.

### Yeah. 

And the team coach as I see it has more contact with the OPOs because they have the teams and they also coach the OPO. So hopefully or most of the time, the team coach for the teach is also the coach for the OPO and is also coaching the OPO so hopefully we get more interaction between the OPO and the manager or the team coach in normal case. But for me as the department manager I have not so much in contact with the OPO more than the stakeholder meeting. As it is today.

### And is it different with the program manager, Niklas?

Niklas I have more contact with, yeah on a daily basis.

### And do you see that your perspectives, can they be in any conflict sometimes? And can it cause some kind of impediment for the teams?

No, you must repeat the question.

### Do you see that these three perspectives: as we take department manager, OPO and program manager and their different area of responsibility and maybe not very clear sharing of responsibilities, can it cause some kind of impediments for the teams? Or is it not possible at all?

As long as there is more than one person, there is always a communication and there is always, there will always be problem that nobody takes care of or double work or thing like that. But I can not see any clear things that you mention with OPO, Niklas and me regarding that constellation that we will cause any problem. Of course it will cause a problem if we don't have the right communication and we miss the information and things like that. That, then it will cause problems but I think we will, if there is any problem we take contact with each other and discuss it. So more like a just in time basis, when needed.

### And if you take a look at the department as a whole: how well do you think information is circulating between different entities?

I have, if we start there. First I have meetings with all my department every second week, information meetings. Where I share some information and also want other to share information between the teams, we have something we call "show and share". Where every time someone, it is rotating between the section so every time it is a new section, that will present anything for other sections in the departments so it is rotating scheme there. Then we have section meetings where we get information out. So from a line perspective we have those kinds of meetings, it's two types of meetings we have regularly. 

### Would you say it is sufficient?

Yeah, I think, I don't think we need to have more of that. I mean it is 1 hour one week and 1,5 hour another week and it is every week. So we have, the section meeting every week and in my information meeting which is 1,5 which is every second week. So I think it's enough information there. Then there is, I always say that the information between the teams there they must work more to get information to spread information between the teams. So I have tried to facilitate that when I introduced the show and share part of my information meeting so we get more information spreading between the teams. 

### So there is not enough?

No, they work with their own. As we had, as we will have today the exhibition day: I think it is very good because when we work in a team we are very focused on that we work with that and people will be working with but if we have done something good it is perhaps not so easy or we don't share with the other teams we store it on an own wiki and other teams will not find it. And we must spread good knowledge and good insights I think so that we can learn from each other and things like that.

### And at what scale is this exhibition? Like is it one department or?

No, it's for the whole organisation. Haven't you get any invitation?

### No.

Then I must send it to you, I will send it after. So it is at 3 o'clock if you have time. So it's down in in nuijsgordan [???] one of the area there.

### And if you take a step even more back and look at the whole Lindholmen Ericsson: do you think the information is circulating between the organisations? And if it doesn't how does it affect your organisation?

I don't know if we had so much information between the different, our different organisation. But one thing regarding Lindholmen, we will right start up with a monthly newsletter regarding Lindholmen sight. Where they collect information regarding the sight and hopefully they will spread information which is actually in this building concerning the people working here. So hopefully that will be increased and perhaps that is enough I think. I don't know if it is good to put a lot of much time on spreading information between... It's case by case and if you want something and ok, how lean from other organisation and we go see how they work and how are they using things. So I think the ordinary information flow, monthly newsletter: it's enough. And I think, but we will, but we hadn't that before it will start this month actually, so it's good that it will start I think.

### What were problems, you mentioned that sometimes even sections don't communicate well between each other and if you take a step out there are kind of countermeasure to improve communication between different parts of the organisation: what were problems caused by not having that? Was it teams just doing double work or being unaware of what their neighbours do or... was there a specific reason where the organisation that: we need to foster communication between sections and even further out?

I think it is quite obvious when you work especially in the same code or in the same product or things like that. And if you have one thing to do in one team and a totally different way to do it in another team and they don't talk to each other it will cause problem. And if you have different tools and different ways of working, different ways of doing things, different guidelines and I mean it's obvious that if one team has done a guideline a of something and another team shall do the same thing and doesn't, don't have any awareness of there is a guideline then we have a problem. Because they also produce a guideline and then we have two guidelines on the exact type of work that shall be done. So that's a problem with double work.

### Does that somehow relate to empowering the teams so much that they have so much responsibility and can decide so much on their own?

Yeah, that could be one of the reasons. That the team, perhaps sometimes take to... I would not say it's a problem that they take too much responsibility but also they, I mean responsibility is something good but and I think it is good to also look outside and not invent all the things by themselves. So if we have a problem, look around and see if somebody has solved that problem and talk to the other teams: "Have you done that? What have you done that for? Have you any suggestions how we can solve that easily?" and things like that. And hopefully we get a better and more easy intranet with wikis and more structure way to put up guidelines so people and teams don't make up their own or inventing the wheel over and over again. I mean it is very important that they go and talk to the different teams and learn from each other.

### Ok we're through. Good timing. 

### Maybe you want something to be mentioned?

No, I mean communication is very important. It is very important between different teams that's what we have talked about here and it's now I think the information channel between the the intranet is very important that you have a structure there and it's very easy if we have, my team is producing anything which is good for other teams then we can publish it on the intranet, on the wiki or things like that. And if we have a very, I mean process or something it is very easy "Ok, now when you are doing this task we have found it out that this way is quite good." and another team can "ok, doing that wasn't quiet so good." and starting to improve and evolve the process as a guideline and things like that. I think that is very important.
