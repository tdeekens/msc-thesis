### What is your role in the organization and with respect to the XFT Picnic?
I an the OPO for the Picnic team, an Operative Product Owner.
### And what are your key responsibilities?
My responsibilities are to decide on priority of the stories or the WP they are working with in the G2 project.
### How may teams do you have in total? Do you work with any other teams?
Yes, I am also working with a team that is called [???], it’s a «wild cat» in Persian.
### Are they G1 or G2?
It’s G2, both are the G2 teams.
### Have you been working here before the transition towards agile?
Yes, I have.
### What have you been doing then?
I have been working as a Project Manager for I think it was like 5 years. Before that I was a team leader and before that I have worked as a software engineer also.
### So you worked here for quite some time…
I have been here for a long time! Don’t ask me how long. Too long, I think :)
### And now, in the agile context, are the responsibilities for your OPO role clearly defined?
I think it is rather clear, but I think we are working rather different in the two programs. I think we are not working exactly the same in the G1 project and in the G2 project. But it’s rather clear, I think, the G2 way of working.
### Why is it different between G1 and G2?
Because it’s 2 departments and we have 2 line organizations and they have different thoughts about it. For the G1 they have a set up for the feature project managers and the OPOs have a lot of teams, I think they have 6 teams each, the 2 OPOs here, so some of the teams are only working with TRs, so that’s not so much work for the OPO. But I think they have at leaf 3 or 4 feature teams so they are just more prioritizing the stories and they are talking to the teams and they are not so much discussing technical things or they are not driving… Because we are also WP drivers in the G2 project, so we are kind of Feature Project Managers or something like that, so we have both the 2 roles, so that’s why we are working different, I think. I think we are more involved in the technical discussions and we are more grooming a lot of things and we have not… In the G1 project, there are doing in big features from the customers and they just break them down and they will just put, push them to the backlog. But in the G2 project they have only said «Ok, you need to make this for this new platform, the new software and this will be released in 15B next year and what will you do to fix this», so then we have more of grooming activities and more of workshops and see what can we do, so the OPOs are more involved in technical discussions and such things.
### What are the roles you communicate most frequently and intense with?
I’m talking a lot to the program managers, Niklas Isaksson for the G2 and Carolina  Narvinger, and I talk a lot to the other OPOs in G2, Stefan [???] and Ingmar [???], and a lot with the CA people. So we are working a lot together with continuous analysis department in Kista, so a lot with Lars Hennert [???] and a lot of persons there. So there is a lot of discussion in the pre-study phase. I think we are also very involved in the pre-study phase in the G2 project also. And then I also discuss a lot with the teams of course.
### Can you think of any events that cause more communication than normally?
Yes, because I think this was a very special thing for me for the Picnic team, because I didn’t talk so much with them, I think you have seen that in the survey. Because I have had a WP in my other team, which the y have been working with, and I have been the WP driver for it and we have had one team here, we have had one team in Linköping and we have had two teams in Kista. So we had a coordinated delivery for that WP last week, it was just the week after the survey. We had a lot of things to discuss before, so that’s why I was not talking so much with the Picnic team, because I’ve talked a lot in the other team. And then I talk a lot with the main — I don’t know if you know this, but we have the main track we are delivering to, we have this common software and we have a lot of, this core team which is responsible for this main track, and they have a meeting and they are sitting in Kista and you must call to them and discuss if it is ok to deliver in which time, «is it ok if we can deliver this tomorrow?» «no, we have this uplift from another things». They have a lot of things, sometimes they have problems with the main track and then we can’t deliver anything. So we had a lot of discussion with them and then I had a lot of discussions with this other, we have 2 verification instances for this main track: we have the main track, the common software, and there we verify it for the CPP platform and it’s for the G1 program, and then we have this for the CS platform so then we verify it on another platform, that’s the G2 project. Then we have discussed with that verification instance and we had to discuss with the other verification instance. It was 2 parts, which had to say it is ok to deliver at the same time, because it’s a common software so we need to have it in place for both sides, that’s very difficult. So it’s a lot of people I communicated by mail, I think it was like 80 people, so 80 people on that list, that day we made the delivery. It was like 100 of mails, it was very tough, I think I was here like 12 hours that day, when we made this delivery, so than it was a lot of communication with all these instances of the verification. It was in Ottawa, and they made some of the tests there and there was a lot of things around. But it was not for the Picnic team, so it was rather strange, because when I was filling in [the survey] for Picnic, «nook, I haven’t talked so much with them», but on the other side I have talked to a lot of people. So it’s different different weeks.
### Does that happen often that communication shifts towards a certain team?
Yeah I think it is like that. Now it was very special for that other team when we had this big delivery. But now I was the WP driver for that team and then it’s more communication, a lot with the other parts and the other teams and everything. Then I think it was switched over because now with Picnic we had a workshop and they have a lot of they must work with every now, so now I think it will be more work with the Picnic team. So I think it’s rather different different weeks.
### Does it work fine, the shift of focus, or are the teams somewhat sometimes a bit left behind because you have to focus on something else?
I think it is working fine when… Now they had a good package, which they are working with documentation and they know, they knew what they should do, so then it’s ok. That’s why we in G2 have chosen that we only have 2 teams, each OPO, because we think it’s too much if we should communicate with so many people.
### And when you communicate with so many different people, do you think there is one single person who takes too much responsibilities and in a way is a bottleneck, causes some kind of stalling?
I think one bottleneck we have in this organization right now for the main track, I think, we have this person Kim Gröndin [???], who is responsible for the main track and he is a coordinator for all this deliveries and he is sending out a mail everyday almost and says «Ok, now you can deliver, now you can deliver, now it’s delivery stop here» etc and he is I think. Because we discussed with him very much that day and then I called him another day and he said «Oh I’m so busy». I think it’s difficult, because you always have some key persons on the top of the organization. I think he needs to have some help, should be more like a team or something. So we have a lot of key persons I think.
### So it does not have to be one person, it can be distributed around more.
No I don’t think so, yeah. I think, he is very good at it so that’s why all others are just «You can talk to him», but I think it’s not so good in the long way.
### You as an OPO, how do you share the information with the XFTs?
I’m talking to them at the stand-up meetings in the morning and then we have these sprint planning meetings and reviews. Then we have a lot of meetings in between. I usually call for meetings when we would like to have meetings with this continuous analysis, the system people, in Kista and if we would like to have connections with other teams, and set up a meeting.
### Would you describe it as a bidirectional communication, both you share information with the team and you get feedback from them as well?
Yes.
### Is it working fine in general or are you missing some kind of information at times?
I think it’s working fine. I don’t know, maybe in this agile transformation thing…Before, when I was a project manager, it was a lot of status information, you talk to a lot of  in information meetings and we have like that. But now, I think, when we changed to this form, I have not take so much information like status and such things, because I think we should try to have it directly from the program managers and the line managers. So I think we have tried, I have tried to minimize my status to the teams, because I think they could have it directly from the other persons, but I don’t know if they like it or not, I don’t know if they think it’s enough or not, I don’t really know. It’s interesting, if you have these interviews with the team members, if they would like to have more of these status information from me, I don’t really know.
### Between OPOs how do you normally share information, what kind of coordination?
We have a meeting with the line, where there are the line manager and all of the OPOs, both in the G1 project and the G2 project. We are discussing which parts in the software we are working on right now, different features, so we try to see if «here it would be a conflict if we would work together» and they can see ok now, we have this delivery or not, so they know when we are doing uplifts or something and if we give more work for the others [???]. So we have such a meeting and then we have, because then it’s a lot of line managers and they would like to have such information for them, but then we have also a secret OPO meeting, it’s only the OPOs and there we are discussing rather free, what do you think the problems are right now. So that’s very good also, I think. So it’s also once a week I think. Then I have a stakeholders meeting, we have with the line manager where they can put in what they would like us to do, if they have something. The line managers or PGs, if they would like to add something in the backlog, or if we would like to have something from the, we have an Interface Guardian, so we have a lot, we have a stakeholder meeting also. And then I have a meeting with Niklas, where he is going through the backlog in Handsoft[???], a backlog meeting for the G2 project. So it’s a lot of meetings. Then I have a big grooming meeting, it’s each third week, we have a grooming meeting with Kista and a lot of people from Linköping and Kista and Lindholmen, we are discussing WPs and trying to find where we have problems. Then we have all these platform, the CS platform, people and we have people from all the rats [???]. It’s the software, we are working with this CAT, it’s a common software, and then we have all the RATS we are saying, it’s NRAT and WRAT and GRAT, it’s for the different standards. The GRAT is for GSM, WRAT is for WCDMA and the LRAT is for LTE. They are also represented at this meeting and we are discussing a lot which WP are the most important right now.
### Does this amount of meeting causes any negative effects on you since you have to coordinate so much stuff as it seems?
I think it’s rather good now. It’s better now, it was more difficult in the beginning, it was very difficult, it was very much discussion about a lot of technical things and then it was very difficult to follow, because everyone has his own problem and then it is very difficult to follow it. But I think we have been better at this grooming meeting to discuss these things.
### What changed, why is it better now?
I don’t really know, if it’s just we have more knowledge now or if we have changed the process. I don’t know, I think it’s more that we have more knowledge about it, I think, the products.
### Would you say that the information circling around you is at times overwhelming and probably you shouldn’t be involved in some parts of it? Maybe you have too many responsibilities.
Yeah, I think sometimes it is too much information, of course. We have a lot of information mails, I think that’s rather difficult, because we have this verification part, the G2 verification department, and we are working with a lot of problems there, and there you can just send out mails if you have a problem, you can just send it out, or if you find something you can just send it out — hen it will be a lot of mails and it’s very difficult to say which part is for me, than you must read everything that is coming and just «Ok, that’s not for me, not for me». So that I think is rather difficult.
### Do you see any way it could be improved?
I don’t really know. Then you need to know which person you would like to send this mail to, that I think is rather difficult right now. I think something should be better, I don’t really know how. But we have a lot of, we are sending a lot of mails where we are using this CC field and that’s not so good, I think, so we have a lot of «just so you know», so that can be a lot better I think.
### Why is the person who is supposed to be a recipient sometimes unknown? Why do you have to guess and instead spread it to anyone instead of the ones who should get it?
I think sometimes you can spread it to anyone. But then it’s a lot of information you don’t want to have, so that’s also difficult.
### But should the sender maybe know who to send it to instead of recipient having to filter all? Why doesn’t the sender know who to send it to, that’s where the problem starts…
Yeah, it should be better if the sender knows who is very interested in this. That’s not so good, I think we need to make something about it. Maybe you can have a solution for that :D
### If you take a step back and look at the organization as a whole, do you think the info ration flow is bad as well? Between different departments or...
I think it’s good from the Program and then down for me and to the Team — that is good in the program. But I think the line organization, I think these two departments, we have a lot of problems with the communication between. I think the teams, they are talking sometimes with each other in the 2 department. The OPOs, we have this secret meeting together, just to talk to each other. But then we have a lot of decisions which are taken by the line managers and they are not talking to each other. I think this is the biggest problem right now, iI think it would be much better if we just had one department. Or they could just talk more together, they have a lot of different view on things, I think.
### And the integration between one department and the agile branch, say works fine or are there also problems at times?
Yeah I think, we have had this discussion on our department, we have this domain teams or product teams, they are very good at one product, and we have one team for each product. And in the other department they would like to have teams for everything, they would just say «You can just shift between» and I think that has been a big problem, because then we can’t discuss with another team, which is good at that product. That has been a problem, but now they all make a change there, that’s good. That has taken one year or so, I think it is so slow.
### Do you think there is lack of support towards transformation to agile somewhere?
Sometimes I think they should have more help. I think the line manager should have more help. I think they have a big problem right now, because they are sitting beside this flow and programs and they can’t really do something, because when we are coming with a new impediment, they are «Oh, what is that?», they can’t really understand the problem and then they can’t go somewhere, they just go back to the team, «What do you think about this?». They don’t have any good way to communicate to others, I think, sometimes they are just «Oh, I don’t know who I should talk to». So I think they ned to have more help on how things should be solved, maybe they need more help from agile coach, I don’t know.
### You as an OPO, your communication with DM, LM, what is it about normally, do you have any?
Yes we have this «pause board» [???] each Friday when we are standing in this coffee corner and we just talk like 5 min about these [???], so it’s just a short meeting. Sometimes you can say, sometimes we have some problems and they just don’t care. That’s not so good I think, because then I would like to have help when I come in there and say I have a problem, and they just say «Ok, we can take it after» and then he just disappears. We have talked about this, to have some more meeting with the line so we have discussions about to add meeting, for the line managers and the OPOs and the teams, where we can say where we have impediments and just talk about the problems and say who can solve this, because otherwise we are just going around. The program managers, they have a meeting with line managers, and when they something to the line managers then the line managers go and ask me about it and then I just go back to the program manager — that’s what we have talked about in another meeting, so it will just go round. So I think it’s good if we have a meeting with all people: the program managers, the teams and the OPO and the line managers.
### So it’s not their lack of willingness to do something it’s rather that they are alienated from the whole process?
I think it’s rather that. I hope they are willing to change this.
### Does it also apply to the Section Managers? As far as we know they are all about removing impediments, so if they are unable to do that it seems kind of severe.
Yeah, I think it’s the Section Managers also. I think all the teams, I think they think it’s a problem too, because we have had a lot of impediments, usually we knew we must solve this by ourselves anyway. «Ok, what can we do? We must make this delivery, so we must have a decision right now» and we just take it, sometimes it’s not so good. Sometimes maybe it’s good also, that the team takes more responsibility. So, it’s both I think.
### Do you think they are in general compatible with the agile way of working?
The line managers? I think they need more education maybe, I think so. Because I think they have a very important role, so I think it’s good if they have more, I think they should be better at this agile work than we are in the teams or in the programs, because we are thinking a lot about these technical solutions so we don’t really have so much time, so we just work as they say in a way. «Ok, we have set up this way of working» and we just work, but I think they need to be more involved in this agile transformation. I think it’s very good that you are here, maybe you can help them.
