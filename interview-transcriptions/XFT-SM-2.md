# What is your role in the organization and with respect to your XFT?
I’m the Scrum Master of an XFT team.

# What are your key responsibilities and tasks you are concerned with?
You mean a s a Scrum Master or…

# You personally. As far as we figure you share your time as a developer and a Scrum Master.
Oh you mean in that sense. I’m hired as a developer, but then I more or less try to get [???] I try to be a Scrum Master or more project oriented and perhaps I’m expected to be that.

# Have you been employed here before the transformation towards agile?
Not as an Ericsson employee, but I have been a consultant at Sony Ericsson and then I have been working when it was not XFTs, not Scrum-based at all and you had all organization instead.

# What kind of responsibilities are added towards you being a Scrum Master from  being a developer?
It’s hard to say actually. Since I am … I think it’s fun to try be a part of program planning and project planning and such things. I have always been striving in that direction, even when I was just a developer. But of course when I’m a Scrum Master I get more attention from… more people are asking me questions because I am a single point of contact in some way for the team. In that sense I am involved in different kind of things all over the organization.

# Is it clearly defined what is included in your responsibilities in your current position?
No, I would say not. Actually, if I compare myself to other Scrum Masters there is a huge difference how you define a Scrum Master role. Some of my colleagues they are just — I shouldn’t say just — they more or less just having stand up meetings and having those regular meetings. As I said, I strive to take it one step further and actually use my position as a Scrum Master to get things changed and give input to other ongoing projects within the organization.

# Do you think that would help other teams as well, having a more vocal Scrum leader who takes up more responsibilities?
No, I think it is dependent on both the team and also the person. I think you need to have both of them within the organization, so if everyone was like me I don’t think it would be good either, because then we shouldn’t have done anything more or less. Then perhaps everyone would try to just talk about, try to make other plans.

# So the rather vague formalization of responsibilities is also kind of good because people can just perform duties the way they want…
Yes, I think so. Exactly, I think it’s good for the organization to have it like that. The only thing that is a bit formalized I think is that it should be I think it’s 10% or 20% of my time should be as a Scrum Master. But that’s not applicable I would say since some Scrum Masters almost don’t spend any time at all on their tasks and I definitely spend more  than 20% on Scrum Master more or less work. But, as I said, I think it is good to have both, it doesn’t matter that much really.

# What are the roles you normally communicate with during your work? If you were to pick 3-5 most frequent and intense.
OPO, of course, and our product owner — that is not the same, even if it is almost the same name, they are different persons — and then of course my section manager. I’d say that, and then I also speak quite a lot with the Scrum Masters of the other APC teams. We are a small product with just 3 teams, we have a lot in common.

# What are the different issues you communicate about with these roles?
With the OPO we discuss typically the ongoing work and the upcoming work, more or less everything that happens during daily basis. With the product owner… if there are some urgent situations or so then typically PO gets informed about that and then she contacts one of us to help us to solve it, give input or so. With SM it could be almost anything. Right now, since we have a new SM we have quite a lot of communication about how are team is working and how we are handling stuff and such things, because he is not aware of the product and he is not aware of this department at all, so he’s been asking a lot of questions about that.

# How in general do you share the information about your XFT’s work to those different roles? For example, to the OPO, PO, SM…
At sprint reviews mainly. All three of them attend when we have sprint reviews, so that’s the normal way. Of course I talk to them on a daily basis as well, but I try to not bring up small things every day. Of course the OPO is always interested in the ongoing work, but, for example, what kind of stories we have finished and so on — that has to wait until we have a proper sprint review.

# Do you communicate with other teams during your work?
Yes, as I said, the other APC teams — these are mainly the teams we are talking about.

# Do you think that your communication is sufficient and efficient? The channels you have, are they always available?
Yes, I must say that works pretty good.

# Do you think it helps that it’s three teams — which is a rather small amount I think — working on the same kind of field? All sitting together and not being spread all over the place?
Yes it definitely is, because it’s quite often that I am sitting in my corner and hear something that they are talking about on the other side of the room, and perhaps I have some answer to their question that they are talking about, or TR, or whatever, then I immediately walk over and say «I have good knowledge about this». So that’s definitely helps.
Then of course, on the other hand, it could be that you listen too much also, something that disturbs your daily work instead. I think it is also different by what kind of person it is. I talk about myself, I have quite hard not talking during the day and I would like to have an open…the possibility to talk to almost anyone anytime, and it doesn’t matter to me, I think I do almost the same good work if I had done if I haven’t spoken to anyone.

# Do you have to talk to there teams at times or is it only those 3?
I would say only those 3 teams, but then I am also involved with this MOM work that we have in our interface, our upper layer of the…that always has our customer’s… where they are monitoring how the RBS system [???] is working. In that work I communicate with quite a lot different teams because there is one MOM responsible in different areas so I need to communicate with them sometimes. So in that sense I come across different teams as well, but more or less in regular work I only speak to these 2 teams.
