# XFT-D-1

- End of Responsibilities
   - Unclear for XFT members (responsibilities do not have clear boundaries)
   - Important when trying to gather information as sources are often unknown
   - Finding a relevant source is time consuming and lowers sprint output
- Lack of Structure in Agile Context
   - Contact person not visible
- Feedback transperancy & roundtrip time
   - Feedback during solving the impediments not present
   - Roundtrip takes long and outcome not visible at times
- Information flood & filtering
   - Too much and too little information reaches XFTs: filtering wished for
- Information spreading
   - Lack thereof still always try to share improvements do not follow proclaimed facts
- Technical environment
   - Interrupts sprints lowers planned velocity
   - No internal interference leads to production
- Missing Vision
   - Lack of immediate goals
   - Lacks clear responsibility for components (code review)
- Healthy Struggle
   - Between DM and PgM

# XFT-D-2

- External response time
   - Short term planning (flexible backlog) leads to faster feedback for XFTs
- Unplanned sprint disruptions
   - Breaks comfort of planned backlog
   - Previous sprint feed back into current one (affects burn down)
   - Negative, immediate effects of non working environment
- SM as spokesperson
   - Try for 30 - 60 minutes otherwise delegate communication to SM, PG
- Interdependent stories
   - Cause loads of communication and upfront analysis
- Sharing with Management
   - Improved after transformation but varied during transformation
- Team knowledge
   - Spread best through demos when sprints in sync
   - Simplifies later finding of knowledge sources
- Information loss
   - Within team for unknown reason but most likely due to low effort
- Over Information
   - Lots of things related to work done related to it
- Development comfort zone
   - Lowers need for communication and sets stage for defined environment
   - Unknown domains bring unknown communication environments
- Capture Information
   - In Wikis for later lookup and async information gathering
- Perfect Sprint: burn down to zero
- Bad Sprint
   - Improve on DoD and task planning
- Broad horizon
   - XFT members should not have specific role
   - Still find comfort zone to excel in
- Automation of Development Environment
   - Deliver faster
- One- vs. two-directional information flow
   - Management pulls but does not push information
- WP mashup
   - Pushed by PgM and tends to cause unplanned work as  planning complexity rises

# XFT-PG-1

- Role Understanding
   - Not too good as not communicated well enough
- Decision responsibilities
   - Unclear for XFTs with respect to PG
   - Blurred between TMs and PGs
- Overloaded solution responsibility
   - XFTs have to maintain their technical environment
- Communication spider web
   - PGs stand between TMs, OPOs and XFTs
- Development Mission
   - Stalling in process by unfamiliarity
- PGs as Bottlenecks
   - NÂ° of teams growing but PGs not
- Multiple perspectives and nescience
   - Discovery of a specific piece of information is not always planned
   - Islands of knowledge
- Information overdosis vs. missing information
   - Hard to reach out and to value what you get
- Direct Information
   - Regarding development and help works well
- Hard issues
   - XFT-SM only responsible for soft impediments SMs acting as relief valve
- Team empowerment
   - Upward communication via OPO intended (also for coordination)
- Team interdependence
   - Makes it impossible to demand of teams to know other teams' domain and status

# XFT-SM-1

- Agility differs
   - LM and agile branch are at a different status regarding agile
   - Track delivery feeds back and hinders continous delivery
- Void of Responsibility
   - Troublesome finding responsible co-worker
   - Agile traditionally does not scale there
- Self Validating Meetings
   - Too much unrelated information
- Natural (non static) Communication
   - Whenever needed and only when of interest
   - Facilitated by LM and more async than sync in nature
   - PMs have to aggregate lots of knowledge, teams need partial (same meeting though)
- Lack of Vision
   - Should be communicated more by PMs and PGs maybe OPOs
   - Vision is not communicated downwards (not a priority by PgMs)
- Sprint Interruptions
   - Feed back of TR or CI
   - Leads to sprint's focus being shifted towards unplanned work
- Productive Sprint
   - Defined packackes, no disturbance and single purpose
- White box analysis is partly left to team to understand dependencies
