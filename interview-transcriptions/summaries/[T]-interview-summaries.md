# XFT-D-1

- End of Responsibilities
   - Unclear for XFT members (responsibilities do not have clear boundaries)
   - Important when trying to gather information as sources are often unknown
   - Finding a relevant source is time consuming and lowers sprint output
- Lack of Structure in Agile Context
   - Contact person not visible
- Feedback transperancy & roundtrip time
   - Feedback during solving the impediments not present
   - Roundtrip takes long and outcome not visible at times
- Information flood & filtering
   - Too much and too little information reaches XFTs: filtering wished for
- Information spreading
   - Lack thereof still always try to share improvements do not follow proclaimed facts
- Technical environment
   - Interrupts sprints lowers planned velocity
   - No internal interference leads to production
- Missing Vision
   - Lack of immediate goals
   - Lacks clear responsibility for components (code review)
- Healthy Struggle
   - Between DM and PgM

# XFT-D-2

- External response time
   - Short term planning (flexible backlog) leads to faster feedback for XFTs
- Unplanned sprint disruptions
   - Breaks comfort of planned backlog
   - Previous sprint feed back into current one (affects burn down)
   - Negative, immediate effects of non working environment
- SM as spokesperson
   - Try for 30 - 60 minutes otherwise delegate communication to SM, PG
- Interdependent stories
   - Cause loads of communication and upfront analysis
- Sharing with Management
   - Improved after transformation but varied during transformation
- Team knowledge
   - Spread best through demos when sprints in sync
   - Simplifies later finding of knowledge sources
- Information loss
   - Within team for unknown reason but most likely due to low effort
- Over Information
   - Lots of things related to work done related to it
- Development comfort zone
   - Lowers need for communication and sets stage for defined environment
   - Unknown domains bring unknown communication environments
- Capture Information
   - In Wikis for later lookup and async information gathering
- Perfect Sprint: burn down to zero
- Bad Sprint
   - Improve on DoD and task planning
- Broad horizon
   - XFT members should not have specific role
   - Still find comfort zone to excel in
- Automation of Development Environment
   - Deliver faster
- One- vs. two-directional information flow
   - Management pulls but does not push information
- WP mashup
   - Pushed by PgM and tends to cause unplanned work as  planning complexity rises

# XFT-PG-1

- Role Understanding
   - Not too good as not communicated well enough
- Decision responsibilities
   - Unclear for XFTs with respect to PG
   - Blurred between TMs and PGs
- Overloaded solution responsibility
   - XFTs have to maintain their technical environment
- Communication spider web
   - PGs stand between TMs, OPOs and XFTs
- Development Mission
   - Stalling in process by unfamiliarity
- PGs as Bottlenecks
   - NÂ° of teams growing but PGs not
- Multiple perspectives and nescience
   - Discovery of a specific piece of information is not always planned
   - Islands of knowledge
- Information overdosis vs. missing information
   - Hard to reach out and to value what you get
- Direct Information
   - Regarding development and help works well
- Hard issues
   - XFT-SM only responsible for soft impediments SMs acting as relief valve
- Team empowerment
   - Upward communication via OPO intended (also for coordination)
- Team interdependence
   - Makes it impossible to demand of teams to know other teams' domain and status

# XFT-SM-1

- Agility differs
   - LM and agile branch are at a different status regarding agile
   - Track delivery feeds back and hinders continous delivery
- Void of Responsibility
   - Troublesome finding responsible co-worker
   - Agile traditionally does not scale there
- Self Validating Meetings
   - Too much unrelated information
- Natural (non static) Communication
   - Whenever needed and only when of interest
   - Facilitated by LM and more async than sync in nature
   - PMs have to aggregate lots of knowledge, teams need partial (same meeting though)
- Lack of Vision
   - Should be communicated more by PMs and PGs maybe OPOs
   - Vision is not communicated downwards (not a priority by PgMs)
- Sprint Interruptions
   - Feed back of TR or CI
   - Leads to sprint's focus being shifted towards unplanned work
- Productive Sprint
   - Defined packackes, no disturbance and single purpose
- White box analysis is partly left to team to understand dependencies

# DM-1

- Low responsibilities
   - Solve issues as low as possible, only bubble up if needed
   - Not always possible due to coordination need even XFTs expect more
   - Smaller world for teams wanted but not always possible
- Balance the transformation
   - XFTs are established 
   - Losing depth by cross view even though depth has been there (not supported by organisation)
   - Strong feature force pulls on code and architectural quality
- Information sharing (pseudo triangle)
   - OPO, Project Managers and DM
   - Parallel communication flow at different speeds both or solely one path
   - Creates rumours and uncertainty - both are waste
   - Is caused by organisational structure (cross-functional organisation)
- Macro information sharing
   - Two programs different time horizons and types of work but same product
   - Communication takes program direction, line tries to balance but improvement needed
   - Threat of detructing other team's work by overlaps 
   - Strategic decision to keep it as one piece of software (price and cost argument)
- Team communication
   - Informal presence but don't attend meetings
   - Not shortcutting intended communication path through SM

# OPO-2

- Role definintions
   - Transformation did not make PO to OPO responsibility change clear
   - No need for clear definition, depend on context
- Sprint interruptions
   - Priorities change: decided to continue work
   - Decisions from management
   - TR and product care - can also be emphasized upon
- Adapt agile way of working
   - Take up more points than sprint ordinary has (should change again)
- Product Ownership
   - Lowered by lack of vision and fostered by big WPs
- Team responsibilities
   - Lost in broadening knowledge - no answers from management
   - Teams split into specialized sub parts
   - Knowledge should diffuse by team work
- Line integration
   - Teams with similar focus are integrated at different lines
   - Causes alienation and causes talking at cross purposes
   - Communication needs to travel up a line as it can not shortcut
   - Overlaps cause need for sync meetings to integrate lines with one another
- Horizontal team communication
   - Lack of mingling: teams isolate and do not informally communicate
   - Only reach out when needed then also efficient
   - Problems: unknown effects on code of others and no discussion
- Agile planning
   - Planned items need to be flexible and interchangeable

# XFT-SM-2

- Role definitions
   - Are dependent on teams: some need vocal members others don't
- Advantages of co-location
   - Communication allows information spreading
   - Also threat of over communicating
- Lack of Vision
   - Communicated only short timeframe 
   - Needed to understand overall sense in work
- Sprint impediments
   - TRs, extra work wrongly estimated stories
   - Unexpected meetings e.g. pre-planning - hunt you if unattented though
- Agile transformation
   - Any part could work agile - just be open-minded towards definitions
   - Old processes clash with agile e.g. in hardware department (externally bound)
- Sprint setup
   - Small stories mapping member's qualifications
   - TRs interrupt progress and can grow while working on them
   - Combine comfort zone stories with ones embodying learning
- Deluted from LN
   - SM might be unable to solve impediments
   - No real connection to DM: lack of understanding towards his role
- Responsibility overload
   - Balance between XFT's being broad but also about distinct borders
   - Overall field to big an complex to grasp all areas
   - Split up teams a bit by specialised responsibilities (e.g. testing)
- Information sharing
   - Lacks points of entry: too many independent wikis
   - Information finding trouble some due to lack of common portal
   - CoPs fine but need to be followed up on
- Macro communication
   - Communication on small scale fine, large scale almost not present
   - Leads to redundant work and clueless employees
   - Integrate by forums or exhibitions

# OPO-1

- Shifts in communication focus
   - WP driving shifts communication
   - Two teams per OPO to minimize risk for overload
- Communication bottleneck
   - Coordination of main track
   - Could be distributed but blocks integration at times
- Information sharing
   - Mostly through meetings with different parties
   - Meetings with co-workers from different fields are hard to follow
   - Meetings involve discussions which don't always lead to conclusion
- Information overload
   - Amount of mails accumulate causing trouble to filter
   - Broadcasting due to unknown reciever
- LN integration
   - Communication between departments hard as lines are separated
   - Information flies by and they are dependent on teams
   - Circular communication whenever solution can not be found
   - Maybe due to personality
- Knowledge build-up
   - Leads to teams being questioned a lot
   - Unproduct sprints as a result there of: solution to spread knowledge
- Agile customer collaboration
   - No promises or deadlines rather unpredictable feature delivery
- Lack of Vision
   - Not communicated to teams but demanded
   - Hard to define as it changes over time
