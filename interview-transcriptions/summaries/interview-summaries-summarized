# Interview 1

- Natural (non static) Communication
   - Whenever needed and only when of interest
   - PMs have to aggregate lots of knowledge, teams need partial (same meeting though)
   - Forced meetings from upwards that give little value for the team (PM, SM/LM)
- Lack of Vision
   - Work not communicated well downwards to the teams, only until the OPO level.
   - Should be communicated more by PMs and PGs maybe OPOs
   - Vision is not communicated downwards (not a priority by PgMs)
- Void of Responsibility
   - Too much of it for the team
   - Troublesome finding responsible co-worker
- Diversity of WPs
   - Diversity of WPs, would have preferred to focus on one domain
