### Interview 1 (XFT-SM-1)
- Natural (non static) Communication
   - Whenever needed and only when of interest
   - PMs have to aggregate lots of knowledge, teams need partial (same meeting though)
   - Forced meetings from upwards that give little value for the team (PM, SM/LM)
- Lack of Vision
   - Work not communicated well downwards to the teams, only until the OPO level.
   - Should be communicated more by PMs and PGs maybe OPOs
   - Vision is not communicated downwards (not a priority by PgMs)
- Void of Responsibility
   - Too much of it for the team
   - Troublesome finding responsible co-worker
- Diversity of WPs
   - Diversity of WPs, would have preferred to focus on one domain

### Interview 2 (XFT-PG)
 - Overloaded solution responsibility
   - Not enough support for the teams, too many responsibilities and not enough competence
   - XFTs have to maintain their technical environment
   - Stalling in process by unfamiliarity
 - Information overflow
   - Too much information, don't know how to filter
   - Hard to know what is going on in the organisation, not well communicated
   - Hard to reach out and to deduct value from all the info you get
- PGs as Bottlenecks
   - NÂ° of teams growing but PGs not
   - Decision responsibilities: unclear for XFTs with respect to PG
   	   - Blurred between TMs and PGs
- Hard issues
   - XFT-SM only responsible for soft impediments SMs acting as relief valve
- Team interdependence
   - Makes it impossible to demand of teams to know other teams' domain and status

### Interview 3 (XFT-D-1)
- Information flood & filtering
   - Too much and too little information reaches XFTs: filtering wished for
   - Lack of a middle man to take out parts of responsibilities and facilitate communication
   - Often do not know who to contact about an issue
   - A lot of communication based on personal contacts
- Very short-term goals for work
   - No agreement on the level of detail work should be provided to the team, different views from different perspectives
   - Not enough feedback btween PgM and the team
   - Lack of immediate goals
- Feedback transperancy & roundtrip time
   - Feedback during solving the impediments not present
   - Roundtrip takes long and outcome not visible at times
   - No transparency in handling of impediments
   - Things happend very quickly when there is one (SM's manager stepping in in the absence of a SM)
- Information discovery by accident
  - Not sufficiently aware of what is going on in the organisation
  - What are other teams working on?
  - Are there any new ideas for doing this and this and this
- Technical environment
   - Interrupts sprints lowers planned velocity
   - No internal interference leads to production

### Interview 4 (XFT-D-2)
- Organisation's transition towards agile
	- Short term planning (flexible backlog) leads to faster feedback for XFTs
- Sprint interruption
	- Previous sprint feed back into current one (affects burn down)
	- Unplanned work coming from other teams
- Information sharing
	- No macro view on the organisation on a bigger scale, what team is working on what etc
		- Team exhibition is a good way to mitigate this
	- Team knowledge spread best through demos when sprints in sync
    - Hunt for information, especially at initial stage
    	- Especially for a WP from an unknown domain/area
    - Teams share their information based on what they think other would like to know
    - In Wikis for later look up and async information gathering
- Interdependent stories cause loads of communication and upfront analysis
- Line Management pulls but does not push information

### Interview 5 (XFT-D-3)
- Sprint Interruption
	- Black work: unplanned work or TRs (<30% of time)
    - TRs can be reassigned with good argument
    - TRs differ in severity (hot to cold) and can be postponed
 - Impediments
 	- Solved by SM and when no SM present also no impediments
	- Mostly hardware related
- Lack of Vision
	- Short term present: one year up front
	- (Pending) Asked for in retrospective

### Interview 6 (XFT-SM-2)
- Communicaton between teams
	- Co-location allows information spreading
	- Also threat of over communicating
- Lack of Vision
	- Communicated only short time frame
    - Needed to understand overall sense in work
    - APO <-> team communication is wished for
- No real connection to DM: lack of understanding towards his role
- Responsibility overload
	- Balance between XFTs being broad but also about distinct borders
	- Team performs best when there are stories fit for everyone's competence
	- Overall field to big an complex to grasp all areas
    - Better to split up work by specialised responsibilities (e.g. testing)
- Information sharing
	- Lacks points of entry: too many independent wikis
    - Information finding trouble some due to lack of common portal
    - Communication on small scale fine, large scale almost not present

### Interview 7 (OPO-1)
- LN integration
	- Communication between departments hard as lines are separated
		- Maybe due to personality
	- Circular communication whenever solution can not be found
    - Need to be more involved in the transformation
- Lack of Vision
	- Not communicated to teams but demanded
	- Hard to define as it changes over time
	- Could increase motivation for team
- Sprint interruptions
	- Picnic doesn't have a sencond team in the product to talk with
	- Single experts in the ANTSYS - need to provide competense to other teams, takes time from sprint
- Information flow
	- WP driving shifts communication focus
	- Amount of mails cause trouble to filter
		- Broadcasting is due to unknown receiver
	- Meetings with co-workers from different fields are hard to follow
	- Responsible for the main track -- coordinates deliveries, a bottleneck

### Interview 8 (DM-1)
- Low responsibilities
	- Solve issues as low as possible, only bubble up if needed
	- Not always possible due to coordination need even XFTs expect more
	- Smaller world for teams wanted but not always possible
- Balance the transformation
	- Losing depth by cross view even though depth has been there (not supported by organisation)
    - Strong feature focus over product focus causes decrease in code and architectural quality
- Information sharing
	-  "Pseudo triangle": OPO, Project Managers and DM
    	- Parallel communication flow at different speeds both or solely one path
    	- Creates rumours and uncertainty for XFTs - both are waste
    - Two programs different time horizons and types of work but same product
    - Communication takes program direction, line tries to balance but improvement needed
    - Threat of destructing other team's work by overlaps

### Interview 9 (OPO-2)
- Role definitions
	- Transformation did not make PO to OPO responsibility change clear
		- No need for clear definition, depend on context
- Sprint interruptions
	- Priorities change: decided to continue work (with PgM)
    - Decisions from management (possible)
    - TR and product care - can also be emphasised upon
    - Teams work more independently during the sprint if assigned to a large main task
- Horizontal team communication
	- Lack of mingling: do not informally communicate
    	- Only reach out when needed, then also efficient
    - Problems: no discussions => unknown effects on code of others
- Line integration
	- Teams with similar focus are integrated at different lines
    	- Communication needs to travel up a line as it can not shortcut
    - Overlaps cause need for sync meetings to integrate lines with one another
- XFTs empowerment: competence up to themselves according to MGMT
	- some tend to split the specialisations between team members
	- learn new competences & distribute knowledge via pair work
	- should have domain competence

### Interview 10 (DM-2)
- Endless transition
	- Initial goals reached but continous improvements continue
    - Organisation (DF) quite homogenous and same spot of transition
- Information sharing
	- Sufficient on the higher level (names numerous meetings)
    - Lack of spreading between teams: don't get out of focus tunnel and share
    	- causes double work, different guidelines, reinventing the wheel (not looking out for existing solutions)
    - Solution: structured intranet not a lot of independent ones
- No immanent friction between PgM, OPO and DM
	- If there are problems - JIT communication

### Interview 11 (PgM-1)
- Line integration
	- Give not-so-necessary tasks to the teams 
    - LN should move towards PgM and not the other way round
    - Are outside the loop and are separated - effort to keep them integrated
	- Define methods and translate words to match
- Information sharing
	- Fetching over sharing (known issue)
    - XFTs should get total picture of task - not always communicated
    	- if the team needs a big picture to solve a complex task
    - Differs between teams: depends on personality and team type
    - Information circling well in Lindholmen (part of the role to know)
		- Cut off between different sites within organisations (CI, system sites)
- Need to adapt methods to differnt teams based, do not push the same for everybody
- (Sometimes) Too much inflence on XFTs at times, bypassing the OPO and their plans

### Interview 12 (PgM-2)
- Agile in the Large
	- Not fully elaborated on within organisation (focus on Scrum mostly)
	- Real world: Customer commitment, long release cycles with late additions
	- Customers are different but moving torwards continuous delivery with them
- XFTs towards customers
	- Closer link to motivate teams
    - Not always direct contact between APO and customers
- Information is sufficient but needs filtering
- Workload around XFTs
	- Too many teams per OPO
	- More work in stock than current setup allows to handle
- Teams tend to escalate problems too late
 
### Interview 13 (XFT-D-4)
- XFT's workflow & interrptions
	- Unclear responsibilities & WoW
		- Originating from non-approved PD process
	- LM absense affected the team only administratively
	- Control over backlog allows for better planning and following work
	- Worse sprints when confirmation of other parties needed
	- Interruptions might come from an OPO as unplanned work
- Unclear communication ways in a big organization
	- Hinder progress and cause frustration for an XFT
	- Create extra-responsibility for a knowledgeable person in an area
	- Issues get lost when approached on a personal level
	- Solution: define these ways by having a weekly meeting where one can bring up and delegate an issue
- Between teams communication
	- Only with APC teams
	- Presentation at a sprint review on work done - good way of knowing abobut other teams
	- Team exhibition to know about other teams than APC
- Information flow and handling
	- Lack of information evaluation: tips & tricks vs approved WoW
	- Huge amounts of unfiltered information on the Intranet - hard to know which is valid
- Vision for the product
	- Not sufficiently communicated
	- Gives an overview of the surroundings so one can establish relevant contacts
