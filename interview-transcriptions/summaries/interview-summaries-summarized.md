# Interview 1

- Natural (non static) Communication
   - Whenever needed and only when of interest
   - PMs have to aggregate lots of knowledge, teams need partial (same meeting though)
   - Forced meetings from upwards that give little value for the team (PM, SM/LM)
- Lack of Vision
   - Work not communicated well downwards to the teams, only until the OPO level.
   - Should be communicated more by PMs and PGs maybe OPOs
   - Vision is not communicated downwards (not a priority by PgMs)
- Void of Responsibility
   - Too much of it for the team
   - Troublesome finding responsible co-worker
- Diversity of WPs
   - Diversity of WPs, would have preferred to focus on one domain

# Interview 2

 - Overloaded solution responsibility
   - Not enough support for the teams, too many responsibilities and not enough competence
   - XFTs have to maintain their technical environment
   - Stalling in process by unfamiliarity
 - Information overflow
   - Too much information, don't know how to filter
   - Hard to know what is going on in the organisation, not well communicated
   - Hard to reach out and to deduct value from all the info you get
- PGs as Bottlenecks
   - NÂ° of teams growing but PGs not
   - Decision responsibilities: unclear for XFTs with respect to PG
   	   - Blurred between TMs and PGs
- Hard issues
   - XFT-SM only responsible for soft impediments SMs acting as relief valve
- Team interdependence
   - Makes it impossible to demand of teams to know other teams' domain and status

# Interview 3

- Information flood & filtering
   - Too much and too little information reaches XFTs: filtering wished for
   - Lack of a middle man to take out parts of responsibilities and facilitate communication
   - Often do not know who to contact about an issue
   - A lot of communication based on personal contacts
- Very short-term goals for work
   - No agreement on the level of detail work should be provided to the team, different views from different perspectives
   - Not enough feedback btween PgM and the team
   - Lack of immediate goals
- Feedback transperancy & roundtrip time
   - Feedback during solving the impediments not present
   - Roundtrip takes long and outcome not visible at times
   - No transparency in handling of impediments
   - Things happend very quickly when there is one (SM's manager stepping in in the absence of a SM)
- Information discovery by accident
  - Not sufficiently aware of what is going on in the organisation
  - What are other teams working on?
  - Are there any new ideas for doing this and this and this
- Technical environment
   - Interrupts sprints lowers planned velocity
   - No internal interference leads to production


# Interview 10 (DM-2)
- Endless transition
	- Initial goals reached but continous improvements continue
    - Organisation (DF) quite homogenous and same spot of transition
- Information sharing
	- Sufficient on the higher level (names numerous meetings)
    - Lack of spreading between teams: don't get out of focus tunnel and share
    	- causes double work, different guidelines, reinventing the wheel (not looking out for existing solutions)
    - Solution: structured intranet not a lot of independent ones
- No immanent friction between PgM, OPO and DM
	- If there are problems - JIT communication


# Interview 11 (PgM-1)
- Line integration
	- Give not-so-necessary tasks to the teams 
    - LN should move towards PgM and not the other way round
    - Are outside the loop and are separated - effort to keep them integrated
	- Define methods and translate words to match
- Information sharing
	- Fetching over sharing (known issue)
    - XFTs should get total picture of task - not always communicated
    	- if the team needs a big picture to solve a complex task
    - Differs between teams: depends on personality and team type
    - Information circling well in Lindholmen (part of the role to know)
		- Cut off between different sites within organisations (CI, system sites)
- Need to adapt methods to differnt teams based, do not push the same for everybody
- (Sometimes) Too much inflence on XFTs at times, bypassing the OPO and their plans


# Interview 12 (PgM-2)
- Agile in the Large
	- Not fully elaborated on within organisation (focus on Scrum mostly)
	- Real world: Customer commitment, long release cycles with late additions
	- Customers are different but moving torwards continuous delivery with them
- XFTs towards customers
	- Closer link to motivate teams
    - Not always direct contact between APO and customers
- Information is sufficient but needs filtering
- Workload around XFTs
	- Too many teams per OPO
	- More work in stock than current setup allows to handle
- Teams tend to escalate problems too late
