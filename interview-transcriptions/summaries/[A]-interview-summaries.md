# Interview 1

- Not a natural way of communication, forced meetings from upwards that give little value for the team (PM, SM/LM)
- Work not communicated well downwards to the teams, only until the OPO level.
- Void of responsibility, too much of it for the team
- Diversity of WPs, would have preferred to focus on one domain

# Interview 2

- Not clear borders of responsibility, teams might not know when to contact PGs
- Not enough support for the teams, too many responsibilities and not enough competence.
- PGs as bottlenecks, the number of teams rises, numbers of PGs doesn't
- Hard to know what is going on in the organisation, not well communicated
  - Too much information, don't know how to filter
  - Team's contact with TM is only via PG


# Interview 3
 
- Not clear responbitilities for the XFT as a whole
  - XFT is responsiblt for everything
- Lack of a middle man to take out parts of responsibilities and facilitate communication
  - Often do not know who to contact about an issue
  - A lot of communication based on personal contacts
  - Information overflow, don't know how to filter it out
- Team coach
  - To take out impediments the team can not handle
  - Provide outside view on things
  - Things happend very quickly when there is one (SM's manager stepping in in the absence of a SM)
- No transparency in handling of impediments
- Not sufficiently aware of what is going on in the organisation
  - What are other teams working on?
  - Are there any new ideas for doing this and this and this
- Very short-term goals for work
  - No agreement on the level of detail work should be provided to the team, different views from different perspectives
  - Not enough feedback btween PgM and the team
 

# Interview 4

- Organisation's transition towards agile:
  - Thing take shorter time
- Unplanned work coming from other teams as an interruption
- Frequent communication with other developers as a norm
  - Originating from dependancies in WPs
  - Lots of inforaml communication (preffered way of solving things)
  - Solve by themself, if affects the whole team/sprint - delegate to ScM
- Lack of transparency in handling impediments
- Lack of information on what is going on around the organisation, what team is working on what etc
  - Team exhibition is a good way to mitigate this
  - Hunt for information, especially at initial stage
    - Especially for a WP from an unknown domain/area
  - Teams share their information based on what they think other would like to know
- Team to LM is one directional

# Interview 5 (XFT-SM-1)



# Interview 6 (OPO-1)

- G1 vs G2
  - G2 OPOs more involved in technical decisions, G1 just get features from customers and put them in the backlog
  - Much communication for OPO in G2 - hence only 2 teams each
    - Time distributed unequally between the two XFTs depending on the stage they are at
- Verification instances: green light needed from both to make a delivery
  - Causes intense communication
  - Responsible for the main track -- coordinates deliveries, a bottleneck
- Status updates should come directly, not through the OPO
- G2 verification dept: lots of emails flying around, don't know which ones are yours or who to send stuff to
- Communication within the program -- good, between departmetns -- not, 2 LM in conflict
  - Differnet approach to XFTs domain expertise in the departments, harder to coordinate
- LM detached from things
  - don't have good ways to communicate with others, often make a circle "solving" the problem
  - Need to be more involved in the transformation
- Picnic doesn't have a sencond team in the porduct to talk with
  - Single expercts in the ANTSYS - need to provide competense to other teams, takes time form sprint
- Much reliance on Kista -- difficulties of distributed communication
