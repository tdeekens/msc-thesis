# Interview 1 (XFT-SM-1)

- Not a natural way of communication, forced meetings from upwards that give little value for the team (PM, SM/LM)
- Work not communicated well downwards to the teams, only until the OPO level.
- Void of responsibility, too much of it for the team
- Diversity of WPs, would have preferred to focus on one domain

# Interview 2 (XFT-PG)

- Not clear borders of responsibility, teams might not know when to contact PGs
- Not enough support for the teams, too many responsibilities and not enough competence.
- PGs as bottlenecks, the number of teams rises, numbers of PGs doesn't
- Hard to know what is going on in the organisation, not well communicated
  - Too much information, don't know how to filter
  - Team's contact with TM is only via PG


# Interview 3 (XFT-D-1)
 
- Not clear responbitilities for the XFT as a whole
  - XFT is responsiblt for everything
- Lack of a middle man to take out parts of responsibilities and facilitate communication
  - Often do not know who to contact about an issue
  - A lot of communication based on personal contacts
  - Information overflow, don't know how to filter it out
- Team coach
  - To take out impediments the team can not handle
  - Provide outside view on things
  - Things happend very quickly when there is one (SM's manager stepping in in the absence of a SM)
- No transparency in handling of impediments
- Not sufficiently aware of what is going on in the organisation
  - What are other teams working on?
  - Are there any new ideas for doing this and this and this
- Very short-term goals for work
  - No agreement on the level of detail work should be provided to the team, different views from different perspectives
  - Not enough feedback btween PgM and the team
 

# Interview 4 (XFT-D-2)

- Organisation's transition towards agile:
  - Things take shorter time
- Unplanned work coming from other teams as an interruption
- Frequent communication with other developers as a norm
  - Originating from dependancies in WPs
  - Lots of inforaml communication (preffered way of solving things)
  - Solve by themself, if affects the whole team/sprint - delegate to ScM
- Lack of transparency in handling impediments
- Lack of information on what is going on around the organisation, what team is working on what etc
  - Team exhibition is a good way to mitigate this
  - Hunt for information, especially at initial stage
    - Especially for a WP from an unknown domain/area
  - Teams share their information based on what they think other would like to know
- Team to LM is one directional

# Interview 5 (XFT-SM-2)

- Single point of contact for the team -- involved in all kind of things
- Communicaton between teams easily accessible, informal, all sit together
- Good possibilities to have input on work in the sprint
- Lack of big picture vision (would be more fun and would improve the wokr in a way)
  - PO has no interest in this vision
- APO - team communication is a good thing
- TR as interruption
- Team performs best when there are stories fit for everyone's competence
- Dunno what DM is doing during the day, but if (huge impediment) {goto DM}
- Too much testing for the team, not enough competence
- No universal way of spreadin ginfo about the XFT's work
  - Also hard to find this stuff for other teams
- Quite bad at talking to each other inside Ercisson (do same things on next floors)
  - Meetings with presentations between departments


# Interview 6 (OPO-1)

- G1 vs G2
  - G2 OPOs more involved in technical decisions, G1 just get features from customers and put them in the backlog
  - Much communication for OPO in G2 - hence only 2 teams each
    - Time distributed unequally between the two XFTs depending on the stage they are at
- Verification instances: green light needed from both to make a delivery
  - Causes intense communication
  - Responsible for the main track -- coordinates deliveries, a bottleneck
- Status updates should come directly, not through the OPO
- G2 verification dept: lots of emails flying around, don't know which ones are yours or who to send stuff to
- Communication within the program -- good, between departmetns -- not, 2 LM in conflict
  - Differnet approach to XFTs domain expertise in the departments, harder to coordinate
- LM detached from things
  - don't have good ways to communicate with others, often make a circle "solving" the problem
  - Need to be more involved in the transformation
- Picnic doesn't have a sencond team in the porduct to talk with
  - Single expercts in the ANTSYS - need to provide competense to other teams, takes time form sprint
- Much reliance on Kista -- difficulties of distributed communication

# Interview 7 (XFT-D-3)
- Only OPO & PG & LM as an immediate circle
  - project managers - far from my responsibility
- Communication between team - ok, upon request
- Black work and TRs as sprint interruprions
- Perfect sprint = no TR and no hardware impediments
- Abbreviation overflow

# Interview 8 (DM-1)
- XFT established for developing software across different products
  - went too far, product depth lost
- Feature focus over product focus: code quality meh
- OPO -> PjM, DM -> PjM, DM -> OPO, DM -> SRM - different info travel speed
  - Rumors travel, info distorted -> XFT who to trust, uncertainty
- Large amount of work for teams -> can not give them responsibility
- Between department communicatin needs improvement
- Keep it low with the XFT, let the SM do it

# Interview 9 (OPO-2)
- OPO vs PO role - dunno where the border
- APO shoul collaborate with PDMgmt by the nature of their work
- Manaemet decision on prioritization might overrule
- G1 - very - strict vs G2 - do - what - you - want
- XFTs empowerment: competence up to themselves, mgmt says
  - should have domain competence
  - learn new competences via pair work
- MS2 is left out from APC by being in different section
 - but te setup is every team should be able to work on anything
- Teams communicate with each other only when needed, not being homies
  - would have helped dicision discussions, now only inside the teams
- Vision more from Ercisson benefits, customer benefit from feature - not always
- Odd set up, split all the way to department, sometimes decision needs to go through Tomas
  - sync meetings for everything

# Interview 10 (DM-2)
- Not a transition towards agile, just improving WoW (transition is over)
  - everyone is in the same level in the agile working
- Piloting communnication with the teams directly
- OPO communication - only in stakeholder meeting, PgM daily
  - in there are problems - JIT communication
- Lots of meetings in the line
- Monthly newsletter in Lindholmen - enough for communication
- Differnt WoW & tools -> different end results from different teams -> double work
- Teams should just talk to each other every time they need
  - intranet as a tool

# Interview 11 (PgM-1)
- Role not clear in the agile context, but some form of coordination needed.
- Fethces information, doesn't spread well
  - if the team needs a big picture to solve a complex task
  - team dependant, some need more info put on them
  - between team collaboration also team dependant
- Vision of the product communicated well to the teams
- Need to adapt methods to differnt teams based, do not push the same for everybody
- Line is distant from the rest of the roganization
  - give not-so-necessary tasks to the teams 
  - need more coaching
- Information circling well in Lindholmen (part of the role to know), not with other sites
  - teams' voice on impediments not heard
- Team <-> OPO - priority communication
  - steering the teams shifts priority

# Interview 12 (PgM-2)
- PgM mostly big scale planning, next release etc
- Focused on Scrum, but not Agile in the large
  - Customers need to be more agile
  - Customers are different in their needs, but move towards continious deployment
- Teams should have more contact with APOs, imroves motivation
- More requrements than resources
- Information is sufficient but need filtering
- I don't want to do this anymore

# Interview 13 (XFT-D-4)
- XFT's workflow & interrptions
	- Unclear responsibilities & WoW
		- Originating from non-approved PD process
	- LM absense affected the team only administratively
	- Control over backlog allows for better planning and following work
	- Worse sprints when confirmation of other parties needed
	- Interruptions might come from an OPO as unplanned work
- Unclear communication ways in a big organization
	- Hinder progress and cause frustration for an XFT
	- Create extra-responsibility for a knowledgeable person in an area
	- Issues get lost when approached on a personal level
	- Solution: define these ways by having a weekly meeting where one can bring up and delegate an issue
- Between teams communication
	- Only with APC teams
	- Presentation at a sprint review on work done - good way of knowing abobut other teams
	- Team exhibition to know about other teams than APC
- Information flow and handling
	- Lack of information evaluation: tips & tricks vs approved WoW
	- Huge amounts of unfiltered information on the Intranet - hard to know which is valid
- Vision for the product
	- Not sufficiently communicated
	- Gives an overview of the surroundings so one can establish relevant contacts
