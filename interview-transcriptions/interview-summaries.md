# Interview 1

- Not a natural way of communication, forced meetings from upwards that give little value for the team (PM, SM/LM)
- Work not communicated well downwards to the teams, only until the OPO level.
- Void of responsibility, too much of it for the team
- Diversity of WPs, would have preferred to focus on one domain
