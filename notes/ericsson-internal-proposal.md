# Initial Thesis Proposal via e-Mail

Agile Software Development rooted in the need to adjust and respond to change quicker to deliver higher business value. Most Agile development processes are geared towards being applied within small, loosely coupled teams all working mostly independent. The promises promoted by Agile’s advocates remain appealing to large scale organizations such as Ericsson. Yet not all benefits might be put into effect possibly due to an intertwined organizational structure.
Ericsson moved from a matrix-like organisational structure towards a hierarchical one with Cross-Functional-Teams at its lower level trying to embrace Agile Software Development: a structure not necessarily prescribed by Agile but motivated by Ericsson’s scale. As performance fluctuations and discrepancies became visible over the course of the transformation, it seems boundaries and connection within the structure may hinder taking full advantage of Agile Software Development.
A thesis’ aim is to investigate possible issues with Agile at scale, flow and blockages within Ericsson’s organizational structure and the creation of fruitful environments fostering self-management and productivity. A more concrete research scope will be determined while decisions upon methods will be made in accordance with the final scope. These could include interviewing, surveying, observations, access to software repositories or other existing relevant data.
