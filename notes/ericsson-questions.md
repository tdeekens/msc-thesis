# Meeting questions

## 1st meeting (10.12.2013)

### Environment at Ericsson

- How many parallel teams work Agile? How big is any difference among them?
   - To how many will we have access to?
- Touch upon problematic aspects of Agile? Scalability, enterprise discipline, geographical and organizational distribution?
- Measuring the degree of acceptance in some

### Topic’s scope

- Which metrics and measurements towards Agile have been performed at Ericsson up until now?
- Should a team’s performance be measured or its application of methodologies?
   - Is productivity through Agile or the agility itself the main objective?
- Should measurements give concrete hints at areas for possible optimizations?
- Why not just transfer mode of operation from successful teams and successful transformations to less successful ones?
   - Are methodologies even team and department specific?
- Where can a distinction between measuring in regard of agile transformation, metrics and maturity be made?
- Is there an aim to generalize findings to be applicable across Ericsson’s context?
- Should a rigorous framework be developed, a pyramid of constructive areas?

### Issues

- Agile is culture fueled, should cultural context be integrated into study?
   - Should measurements even include perceived culture by employees?
- Metrics mostly User Story and Sprint centric, expected vs. actual, schedule vs. forecast for velocity trends, burnup/down, member loads, test reports
   - Should qualitative study be underpinned using quantitative support?

### Existing Research

- *Transformation*
   - Role change analysis (contrasting plan and actual degree of adoption)
   - Acceptance study (value perception of process, measure self-management)
   - Measure agile values (e.g. collective ownership in a large corp)
   - Methodology efficiency (incorporation of suggestions by retrospectives)
   - Agile characteristics (suitability of characteristics, acceptance and correctness)
- *Measurementsn*
   - Performance (Balanced Scorecard, KPI, Throughput Accounting)
   - Work control charts
   - Agile & Lean SD Production Metrics (Cost metrics, Quality metrics, Predictability metrics)
   - Goal-Question-Metric
   regarding practices underpinned by defect counts (closing speed)
   qualitative study paired with quantitative data as question
   - Adaptable Measurement Framework (AMP)
- *Maturity*
   - Level based (akin to CMMI)
      - incorporates methodologies, communication flow and performance
   - Lean MMs (Maturity Models)
      - grid based check points: organisation vs. project to scaling

### Organizational issues

- Degree of cooperation with Ericsson? Work location? Supervision and surveys?
- Contracts, agreements and NDAs in regard to possible publication?
   - Deadlines
   - Proposal must be submitted by 20th of January
   - Halfway seminar in March (TBD)
   - Thesis should be done by mid July

### Proposal issues

- A *problem* might be defined as the issue that exists in the literature, theory, or practice that leads to a need for the study.
   - Research questions
   - Hypothesis
- *Purpose of the study:* briefly define and delimit the specific area of the research. Incorporate the rationale for the study.
- *Literature review:* should establish the need for the research and indicate that the writer is knowledgeable about the area
   - Define the starting point for your study - how will your study refine, revise, or extend what is now known?
- *Design:*
   - Methods
   - Data collection (survey administration procedures, interview or observation procedures)
   - Data analysis
- *Significance of the study:*
   Indicate how your research will refine, revise, or extend existing knowledge in the area under investigation.
