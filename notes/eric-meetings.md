### Maturity

- Level based (akin to CMMI)
   - incorporates methodologies, communication flow and performance
- Lean MMs (Maturity Models)
   - grid based check points: organisation vs. project to scaling

### Possible open issues

- Petri Heiramo observes that the retrospectives lack measurements and argues that it can lead to undesirable results [5]. [Thesis]
Case studies in regard to Maturity Models rarely conducted

### Formalities

- Working location, tightness of cooperation, time constraints,
