\begin{abstract}

Agile software development has been put forward in response to the industry's need to embrace and adjust to change quicker to be able to deliver higher business value. Even though agile's practices have been originally defined for small, single-product companies, their successful implementations have lead to it being recognised by large multi-site and product corporations. Transitioning towards agile and a new work environment embodies challenges of different natures, especially for large-scale organisations. This thesis presents a case study performed at Ericsson AB where the challenges related to information and communication flow within a large-scale agile organisation are investigated. The findings are then put into organisational context and related to the productivity determinants of Cross Functional Teams (XFTs).

Keywords: agile at scale, information, communication, XFT empowerment

\section*{Acknowledgements}

This research project would not have been possible without the support of many people. Foremost, we would like to express our special appreciation and thanks to our supervisors Eric Knauss and Mats Eriksson. Both have been great mentors and of tremendous help in guiding and shaping the thesis' outline. We would also like to thank all participants of our interviews and surveys and everybody who assisted with answers towards our questions and gave valuable feedback. Last but not least, we would like to thank Swedish Institute (SI) who supported Anna during the time of her studies at Chalmers University of Technology with a Visby scholarship.
