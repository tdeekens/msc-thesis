\subsection{Role Descriptions \& Definitions}

The setting of this case study is peculiar to a single organisation and thus calls for additional description. With the elements of the pre-transformation organisational structure still in place and introduction of the new units called for by Scrums' methods, boarders between the responsibilities of different roles might at times seem unclear.
